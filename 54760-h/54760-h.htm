earth is but as an atom in space, a star amongst stars. Yet, to us
who inhabit it, it is still without bounds, as it was in the time of
our barbarian ancestors. Nor can we foresee the period when the
whole of its surface will be known to us. We have been taught
by astronomers and geodesists that our planet is a sphere flattened
at the poles, and physical geographers and meteorologists have applied their
powers of inductive reasoning to establish theories on the direction of the winds
and ocean currents within the polar regions. But hitherto no explorer has
succeeded in reaching the extremities of our earth, and no one can tell whether
land or sea extends beyond those icy barriers which have frustrated our most
determined efforts. Thanks to the struggles of indomitable seamen, the pride of
our race, the area of the mysterious regions around the north pole has been
reduced to something like the hundredth part of the earth’s surface, but in the
south there still remains an unknown region of such vast extent, that the moon,
were she to drop upon our planet, might disappear within it without coming into
contact with any part of the earth’s surface already known to us.</p>

<p>And the polar regions, which present so many natural obstacles to our
explorers, are not the only portions of the earth not yet known to men of science.
It may be humiliating to our pride as men, but we feel constrained to admit that
among the countries not yet known to us there are some, accessible enough as
far as natural obstacles are concerned, but closed against us by our fellow-men&#x202f;!
There are peoples in this world, dwelling in towns, obeying laws, and having
customs comparatively polished, but who choose to live in seclusion, and are as
little known to us as if they were the inhabitants of some other planet. Their
frontiers are closed by war and its horrors, by the practice of slavery,
by religious <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
fanaticism, and even commercial jealousy. We have heard of some of these
peoples by vague report, but there are others concerning whom we absolutely
know nothing. And thus it happens that in this age of steam, of the printing
press, of incessant and feverish activity, we still know nothing, or very little, of
the centre of Africa, of a portion of Australia, of the interior of that fine and
no doubt most fertile island of New Guinea, and of vast table-lands in the centre
of Asia. Nay, even the country which most men of learning love to look upon as
the cradle of our Aryan ancestors is known to us but very imperfectly.</p>

<p>As regards most countries which have been visited by travellers, and figure
more or less correctly upon our maps, a great amount of further research is
required before our knowledge of their geography can be called complete. Years
will pass ere the erroneous and contradictory statements of our explorers concerning
them have been set right. A prodigious amount of labour must be
performed before their climate, their hydrography, their plants and animals, can
be thoroughly known to us. Minute and systematic researches have to be
conducted to elucidate the slow changes in the aspects and physical phenomena
of many countries. The greatest caution will have to be exercised in distinguishing
between changes due to the spontaneous action of natural causes and those brought
about by the hand of man. And all this knowledge we must acquire before we
can boast that we know the earth, and all about it&#x202f;!</p>

<p>Nor is this all. By a natural bent of our mind, all our studies are carried
on with reference to Man as the centre of all things. A knowledge of our planet
is, therefore, imperfect as long as it is not joined to a knowledge of the various
races of man which inhabit it. The earth which man treads is but imperfectly
known, man himself even less so. The first origin of races is shrouded in absolute
darkness, and the most learned disagree with reference to the descent, the
amalgamation, the original seats, and migratory stages of most peoples and
tribes. What do men owe to their surroundings? What to the original seats
of their ancestors, to inborn instincts of race, to a blending with alien races,
or to influences and traditions brought to bear upon them from beyond? We
hardly know, and as yet only a few rays of light begin to penetrate this darkness.
Unfortunately our erroneous views on many of these questions are not due solely
to ignorance. Contending passions and instinctive national hatreds too frequently
obscure our judgment, and we see man as he is not. The far-off savages assume
the shape of dim phantoms, and our near neighbours and rivals in the arts of
civilisation appear repulsive and deformed of feature. If we would see them as
they really are, we must get rid of all our prejudices, and of those feelings of
contempt, hatred, and passion which still set nation against nation. Our
forefathers,
in their wisdom, said that the most difficult thing of all was to know
one’s self. Surely a comprehensive study of mankind is more difficult still.</p>

<p>We are thus not in a position at present to furnish a complete account of the
earth and its inhabitants. The accomplishment of this task we must leave to the
future, when fellow-workers from all quarters of the globe will meet to write
the grand book embodying the sum of human knowledge. For
the present an <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
individual author must rest content with giving a succinct account of the Earth,
in which the space occupied by each country shall be proportionate to its importance,
and to the knowledge we possess with respect to it.</p>

<p>It is natural, perhaps, that each nation should imagine that in such a
description it ought to be accorded the foremost place. Every barbarous tribe,
however small, imagines itself to occupy the very centre of the earth, and to be the
most perfect representative of the human race. Its language never fails to bear
witness to this naïve illusion, born of the very narrowness of its horizon. The
river which irrigates its fields is called the “Father of Waters,” the mountain
which shelters its camp the “Navel,” or “Centre of the Earth;” and the names
by which primitive races designate their neighbours are terms of contempt, for
they look down upon them as their inferiors. To them they are “mute,” “deaf,”
“unclean,” “imbecile,” “monstrous,” or “demoniac.” The Chinese, one of the
most remarkable peoples in some respects, and certainly the most important of all
as far as mere numbers go, are not content with having bestowed upon their
country the epithet of “Flower of the Centre,” but are so fully convinced of its
superiority as to have fallen into the mistake (very excusable under the circumstances)
of deeming themselves to be the “Sons of Heaven.” As to the nations
thinly scattered around the borders of their “Celestial Empire,” they know them
merely as “dogs,” “swine,” “demons,” and “savages.” Or, more disdainful still,
they designate them by the four cardinal points of the compass, and speak of the
“unclean” tribes of the west, the north, the east, and the south.</p>

<p>If in our description of the Earth we accord the first place to civilised Europe,
it is not because of a prejudice similar to that of the Chinese. No&#x202f;! this place
belongs to Europe as a matter of right. Europe as yet is the only continent the
whole of whose surface has been scien­tif­i­cally explored. It possesses a map
ap­prox­i­mate­ly cor­rect, and its material resources are almost fully known to us.
Its population is not as dense as that of India or of China, but it nevertheless
contains about one-fourth of the total population of the globe; and its inhabitants,
whatever their failings and vices, or their state of barbarism in some respects, still
impel the rest of mankind as regards material and mental progress. Europe, for
twenty-five centuries, has been the focus whence radiated Arts, Sciences, and
Thought. Nor have those hardy colonists who carried their European languages
and customs beyond the sea succeeded hitherto in giving to the New World an
importance equal to that of “little” Europe, in spite of the virgin soil and vast
area which gave them scope for unlimited expansion.</p>

<p>Our American rivals may be more active and enterprising than we are—they
certainly are not cumbered to the same extent by the traditions and inheritances
of feudal times—but they are as yet not sufficiently numerous to compete with us
as regards the totality of work done. They have scarcely been able hitherto to
ascertain the material resources of the country in which they have made their
home. “Old Europe,” where every clod of earth has its history, where every man
is the heir of a hundred successive generations, therefore still maintains the first
place, and a comparative study of nations justifies us in the belief
that its moral <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
ascendancy and industrial preponderance will remain with it for many years to come.
At the same time, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that equality will obtain
in the end, not only between America and Europe, but also between these two and
the other quarters of the world. The intermingling of nations, migrations which
have assumed prodigious proportions, and the increasing facilities of intercourse
must in the end lead to an equilibrium of population being established throughout
the world. Then will each country add its proper share to the wealth of mankind,
and what we call civilisation will have “its centre everywhere, its periphery
nowhere.”</p>

<p>The central geographical position of Europe has undoubtedly exercised a
most favourable influence upon the progress of the nations inhabiting it. The
superiority of the Europeans is certainly not due to the inherent virtues of the
races from which they sprang, as is vainly imagined by some, for in other parts of
the ancient world these same races have exhibited far less creative genius. To
the happy conditions of soil, climate, configuration, and geographical position the
inhabitants of Europe owe the honour of having been the first to obtain a
knowledge of the earth in its entirety, and to have remained for so long a period
at the head of mankind. Historical geographers are, therefore, right when they
insist upon the influence which the configuration of a country exercises upon the
nations who inhabit it. The extent of table-lands, the heights of mountain
ranges, the direction and volume of rivers, the vicinity of the ocean, the indentation
of the coast-line, the temperature of the air, the abundance or rarity of rain,
and the correlations between soil, air, and water—all these are pregnant with
effects, and explain much of the character and mode of life of primitive nations.
They account for most of the contrasts existing between nations subject to
different conditions, and point out the natural highways of the globe which
nations are constrained to follow in their migrations or warlike expeditions.</p>

<p>At the same time, we must bear in mind that the influence exercised upon
the history of mankind by the general configuration of land and sea, or any
special features of the former, is subject to change, and depends essentially upon
the stage of culture at which nations have arrived. Geography, strictly speaking,
confines itself to a description of the earth’s surface, and exhibits the various
nations in a passive attitude as it were, whilst Historical Geography and statistics
show man engaged in the struggle for existence, and striving to obtain the mastery
over his surroundings. A river, which to an uncultured tribe would constitute an
insurmountable barrier, becomes a commercial high-road to a tribe further advanced
in culture, and in process of time it may be converted into a mere canal of
irrigation, the course of which is regulated by man. A mountain range frequented
by shepherds and huntsmen, and forming a barrier between nations, may attract,
in a more civilised epoch, the miner and the manufacturer, and in course of time
will even cease to be an obstacle, as roads will traverse it in all directions. Many a
creek of the sea, which afforded shelter of yore to the small vessels of our ancestors,
is deserted now, whilst the open bays, which vessels dreaded formerly, have been
protected by enormous breakwaters, and have become the resort of
our largest ships. <span class="xxpn" id="p005a">{5a}</span></p>

<p>Innumerable changes such as these have been effected by man in all parts of
the world, and they have revolutionised the correlations existing between man and
the land he lives in. The configuration and height of mountains and table-lands,
the indentation of the coasts, the disposition of islands and archipelagos, and the
extent of the ocean—these all lose their relative influence upon the history of
nations in proportion as the latter emancipate themselves and become free
agents. Though subject to the condition of his dwelling-place, man may modify
it to suit his own purpose; he may overcome nature as it were, and convert the
energies of the earth into domesticated forces. As an instance we may point to
the elevated table-lands of Central Asia, which now separate the countries and
peninsulas surrounding them, but which, when they shall have become the seats of
human industry, will convert Asia into a real geographical unit, which at present
it is only in appearance. Massy and ponderous Africa, monotonous Australia, and
Southern America with its forests and waterfalls, will be put on something like an
equality with Europe, whenever roads of commerce shall cross them in all
directions, bridging their rivers, and traversing their deserts and mountain ranges.
The advantages, on the other hand, which Europe derives from its backbone of
mountains, its radiating rivers, the contours of its coasts, and its generally well-balanced
outline are not as great now as they were when man was dependent
exclusively upon the resources furnished by nature.</p>

<p>This gradual change in the historical importance of the configuration of the
land is a fact of capital importance which must be borne in mind if we would
understand the general geography of Europe. In studying <span class="smmaj">SPACE</span>
 we must take
account of another element of equal value—<span class="smmaj">TIME.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">The
dwellers on the eastern shores of the Med­i­ter­ra­nean
Sea must have learnt, in
the course of their first warlike and commercial expeditions, to distinguish between
the great continents; for within the nucleus of the ancient world Africa is
attached to Asia by a narrow band of arid sand, and Europe separated from Asia
Minor by seas and channels difficult to navigate on account of dangerous currents.
The division of the known world into three distinct parts could not fail to impress
itself upon the minds of those infant nations; and when the Greeks had attained
a state of maturity, and historical records took the place of myths and oral traditions,
the name of Europe had probably been transmitted through a long series of
generations. Herodotus naïvely admits that no mortal could ever hope to find
out the true meaning of this name, bequeathed to us by our forefathers; but this
has not deterred our modern men of learning from attempting to explain it.
Some amongst them consider that it was applied at first to Thrace with its “large
plains,” and subsequently extended to the whole of Europe; others derive it from
one of the surnames of Zeus with the “large eyes,” the ancient god of the Sun,
specially charged with the protection of the continent. Some etymologists believe
that Europe was designated thus by the Phœnicians, as being the country of
“white men.” We consider it, however, to be far more probable that its name
originally meant simply “the West,” as contrasted with Asia, “the East,” or
“country of the rising sun.” It is thus that Italy first, and then Spain, bore the
name of Hesperia; that Western Africa received the name of El Maghreb from
the Mo­ham­me­dans, and the plains beyond the Mississippi became known in our
own times as the “Far West.”</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the original meaning of its name, Europe, in all the
myths of the ancients, is described as a Daughter of Asia. The Phœnicians were
the first to explore the shores of Europe, and to bring its inhabitants into contact
with those of the East. When the Daughter had become
the superior of her <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
Mother in civilisation, and Greek voyagers were following up the explorations
begun by the mariners of Tyre, all the known countries to the north of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean were looked upon as dependencies of Europe, and that name, which
was originally confined to the Thraco-Hellenic peninsula, was made to include, in
course of time, Italy, Spain, the countries of the Gauls, and the hyperborean
regions beyond the Alps and the Danube. Strabo, to whom were known already
the most varied and fruitful portions of Europe, extends it eastward as far as the

<p>Since that epoch the limits between Europe and Asia have been shifted by
geographers still further to the east. They are, however, more or less conventional,
for Europe, though bounded on three sides by the ocean, is in reality
but a peninsula of Asia. At the same time, the contrasts between these two parts
of the world fully justify scientific men in dividing them into two continental
masses. But where is the true line of separation between them? Map-makers
generally adopt the political boundaries which it has pleased the Russian
Government to draw between its vast European and Asiatic territories, and others
adopt the summits of the Ural Mountains and of the Caucasus as the boundary
between the two continents; and although, at the first glance, this delineation
appears more reasonable than the former, it is in reality no less absurd. The
two slopes of a mountain chain can never be assigned to different formations, and
they are generally inhabited by men of the same race. The true line of separation
between Europe and Asia does not consist of mountains at all, but, on the
contrary, of a series of depressions, in former times covered by a channel of the
sea which united the Me­di­ter­ra­nean with the Arctic Ocean. The steppes of
the Manych, between the Black Sea and the Caspian, and to the north of the
Caucasus, are still covered in part with salt swamps. The Caspian itself, as well as
Lake Aral and the other lakes which we meet with in the direction of the Gulf of
Obi, are the remains of this ancient arm of the sea, and the intermediate regions
still bear the traces of having been an ancient sea-bed.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that vast changes have taken place in
the configuration <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
of Europe, not only during more ancient geological periods, but also within
comparatively recent times. We have already seen that a vast arm of the sea
formerly separated Europe from Asia; it is equally certain that there was a time
when it was joined to Anatolia by an isthmus, which has since been converted into
the Bosphorus of Constantinople; Spain was joined to Africa until the waters of
the Atlantic invaded the Me­di­ter­ra­nean; Sicily was probably connected with
Mauritania; and the British Islands once formed a portion of the mainland. The
erosion of the sea, as well as upheavals and subsidences of land, has effected, and
still effect, changes in the contours of our coasts. Numerous soundings in the
seas washing Western Europe have revealed the existence of a submarine plateau,
which, from a geological point of view, must be looked upon as forming an integral
portion of our continent. Bounded by abyssal depths of thousands of fathoms,
and submerged one hundred fathoms at most below the waters of the ocean, this
pedestal of France and the British Islands must be looked upon as the foundation
of an ancient continent, destroyed by the incessant action of the waves. If the
shallow portions of the ocean, as well as those of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean Sea, were to be
added to Europe, its area would be increased to the extent of one-fourth, but it
would lose, at the same time, that wealth in peninsulas which has secured to Europe
its historical superiority over the other continents.</p>

<p>If we supposed Europe to subside to the extent of one hundred fathoms, its
area would be reduced to the compass of one-half. The ocean would again cover her
low plains, most of which are ancient sea-beds, and there would remain above the
waters merely a skeleton of plateaux and mountain ranges, far more extensively
indented by bays and fringed by peninsulas than are the coasts existing at the
present time. The whole of Western and Southern Europe would be converted
into a huge island, separated by a wide arm of the sea from the plains of interior
Russia. From an historical as well as a geological point of view, this huge
island is the true Europe. Russia is not only half Asiatic on account of its
extremes of temperature, and the aspect of its monotonous plains and interminable
steppes, but is likewise intimately linked with Asia as regards its inhabitants and
its historical development. Russia can hardly be said to have belonged to Europe
for more than a hundred years. It was in maritime and mountainous Europe,
with its islands, peninsulas, and valleys, its varied features and unexpected
contrasts, that modern civilisation arose, the result of innumerable local civilisations,
happily united into a single current. And, as the rivers descending from the
mountains cover the plains at their foot with fertile soil, so has the progress
accomplished in this centre of enlightenment gradually spread over the other
continents to the very extremities of the earth.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The Europe alluded to includes France, Germany, England, and the three
Me­di­ter­ra­nean peninsulas, and constitutes several natural divisions. The British
Islands form one of these. The Iberian peninsula
is separated scarcely less <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
distinctly from the remainder of Europe, for between it and France rises a
most formidable range of mountains, the most difficult to cross in all Europe; and
immediately to the north of it a depression, nowhere exceeding a height of
650 feet, extends from the Me­di­ter­ra­nean to the Atlantic Ocean. The
geographical unity of Europe is represented to the full extent only in the system
of the Alps, and in the mountains of France, Germany, Italy, and the Balkan
peninsula which are connected with it. It is there we must seek the framework
of continental Europe.</p>

<p>The Alps, whose ancient Celtic name probably refers to the whiteness of their
snowy summits, stretch in an immense curve, more than 600 miles in length,
from the shores of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean to the plains of the Danube. They consist
in reality of more than thirty mountain masses, representing as many geological
groups, and joined to each other by elevated passes; but their rocks, whether
they be granite, slate, sandstone, or limestone, form one continuous rampart rising
above the plains. In former ages the Alps were higher than they are now. This
is proved by an examination of their detritus and of the strata disintegrated
by natural agencies. But, whatever the extent of detrition, they still rise in
hundreds of summits beyond the line of perennial snow, and vast rivers of ice
descend from them into every upland valley. Looked at from the plains of
Piedmont and Lombardy, these glaciers and snow-fields present the appearance of
sparkling diadems encircling the mountain summits.</p>

<p>In the eastern portion of the Alpine system—that is to say, between the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean and Mont Blanc, the culminating point of Europe—the average
height of the mountain groups gradually increases from 6,500 to more than
13,000 feet. To the east of Mont Blanc the Alps change in direction, and,
beyond the vast citadels represented by Monte Rosa and the Bernese Oberland,
they gradually decrease in height. To the east of Switzerland no summit exceeds
a height of 13,000 feet, but this loss in elevation is fully made up by increase of
breadth. And whilst the general direction of the principal axis of the Alps
remains north-easterly, very considerable mountain chains, far exceeding the
central mass in breadth, are thrown off towards the north, the east, and the
south-east. A line drawn across the true Alps from Vienna has a length of no
less than 250 miles.</p>

<p>In thus spreading out, the Alps lose their character and aspect. We no longer
meet with grand mountain masses, glaciers, and snow-fields. Towards the north
they gradually sink down into the valley of the Danube; towards the south they
branch out into secondary chains, resting upon the arched plateau of Turkey.
But, in spite of the vast contrasts offered by the true Alps and the mountains of
Montenegro, the Hæmus, the Rhodope, and the Pindus, all these mountain chains
nevertheless belong to the same orographical system. The whole of the Balkan
peninsula must be looked upon as a natural dependency of the Alps; and the same
applies to Italy, for the chain of the Apennines is nothing but a continuation
of the Maritime Alps, and we hardly know where to draw the line of separation
between them. The Carpathians, too, must
be included among the <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
mountain chains forming part of the system of the Alps. They have been
gradually separated from them through the continuous action of water, but there
can be no doubt that, in former times, the semicircle of mountains known as the
Little Carpathians, the Beskids, the Tatra, the Great Carpathians, and the Transylvanian
Alps was joined, on the one hand, to the Austrian Alps, and on the other
to spurs descending from the Balkan. The Danube has forced its way through
these mountain ramparts, but the passages, or “gates,” are narrow; they are strewn
with rocks, and commanded by what remains of the ancient partition ranges.</p>

<p>The configuration of the Alps, and of the labyrinthine mountain ranges branching
off from them towards the east, could not fail to exercise a most powerful influence
upon the history of Europe and of the entire world. The only high-roads known
to barbarians are those traced out by nature herself, and they were consequently
able to penetrate into Europe only by sea, or through the vast plains of the north.
Having penetrated to the westward of the Black Sea, their progress was first
stopped by the lakes and difficult swamps of the Danubian valley; and, when
they had surmounted these obstacles, they found themselves face to face with a
barrier of high mountains, whose intricate wooded valleys and declivities led up
to the inaccessible regions of eternal snow. The Alps, the Balkan, and all the
other advanced chains of the Alpine system constituted an advanced defensive
barrier for Western Europe, and the conquering nomad tribes who threw themselves
against it did so at the risk of destruction. Accustomed to the boundless
horizon of the steppes, they did not venture to climb these steep hills—they
turned to the northward, where the vast plains of Germania enabled successive
swarms of immigrants to spread over the country with greater ease. And as to the
invaders, whom blind rage of conquest impelled to engage in the defiles of these
mountains, they found themselves caught as in a trap; and this accounts for the
variety of nations, and of fragments of nations, whose presence has converted the
countries of the Danube into a sort of ethnological chaos. And as the débris
carried along by the current is deposited in the eddy of a river, so were these
fragments of nearly every nation of the East accumulated in motley disorder in
this corner of the Continent.</p>

<p>To the south of this great mountain barrier the migrations between Europe
and Asia could take place only by sea—a high-road open to those nations alone
who were sufficiently advanced in civilisation to have acquired the art of building
ships. Whether pirates, merchants, or warriors, they had raised themselves long
ago above a state of primitive barbarism, and even their voyages of conquest added
something to the stock of human knowledge. Moreover, owing to the difficulties
of navigation, they migrated only in small bodies. At whatever point they settled
they came into contact with populations of a different race from their own, and this
intercourse gave birth to a number of local civilisations, each bearing its own stamp,
and nowhere did their influence preponderate. Every island of the Archipelago, and
every valley of ancient Hellas, differed from its neighbours as regards social condition,
dialect, and customs, but they all remained Greek, in spite of the Phœnician
and other influences to which they had been subjected. It is
thus owing to the <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
configuration of the mountain chains and coast-lines that the civilisation which
developed itself gradually in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean countries to the south of the Alps
was, upon the whole, more spontaneous in its nature, and offered more variety
and greater contrasts, than the civilisation of the far less advanced nations of the
north, who were moving from place to place on vast plains.</p>

<p>The wide range of the Alps and of their advanced chains thus separated two
distinct worlds, in which historical development went on at a different rate. At
the same time, the separation between the two slopes of the Alpine system was by
no means complete. Nowhere in the Alps do we meet with cold and uninhabited
plateaux, as in the Andes and in Tibet, whose enormous extent forms almost
insurmountable barriers. The Alpine masses are cut up everywhere into mountains
and valleys, and the climate of the latter is sufficiently mild to enable man to
exist in them. The mountaineers, who easily maintained their independence,
owing to the protection extended to them by nature, first served as intermediaries
between the peoples inhabiting the opposite lowlands. It was they who effected
the rare exchanges of produce which took place between the North and South,
and who opened the first commercial high-roads between the summits of the mountains.
The direction of the valleys and the deeply cut mountain passes even then
indicated the grand routes by which the Alps would be crossed, at a future period,
for the purposes of commerce or of war. That portion of the Alps which lies
between the mountain masses of Savoy and of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean would naturally
cease first to form an obstacle to military expeditions. The Alps there
are of great height, it is true, but they are narrower than anywhere else; besides
which, the climate on the two opposite slopes is similar, and assimilates the mode
of life and the customs of the people dwelling there. Far more formidable, as a
natural barrier, are the Alps to the north-east of Mont Blanc, for they constitute a
climatic boundary.</p>

<p>The other mountain ranges play but a secondary or local part in the history of
Europe, when we compare them with the Alps. Still, the influence which they
have exercised upon the destiny of nations is no less evident. The table-lands and
snow-fields of the Scandinavian Alps form a wall of separation between Norwegians
and Swedes. The quadrangular mountain fort of Bohemia, in the centre of Europe,
which shelters the Chechians, is almost entirely enclosed by Germans, and resembles
an island fretted by the waves of the ocean. The hills of Wales and of Scotland
have afforded a shelter to the Celtic race against the encroachments of
Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans. The Bretons, in France, are indebted to
their rocks and <i>landes</i> for the fact of their not having yet become wholly French;
whilst the table-land of Limousin, the hills of Auvergne and the Cevennes constitute
the principal cause of the striking contrast which still exists between
the inhabitants of Northern and of Southern France. The Pyrenees, next to
the Alps, constitute the most formidable obstacle to the march of nations in
Europe; they would have remained an insurmountable rampart down to our
own time, were it not easy to pass round them by their extremities abutting upon
the sea. <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">The valleys which radiate in all directions from the great central masses of the
Alps are admirably adapted for imparting to almost the whole of Europe a
remarkable unity, whilst they offer, at the same time, an extreme variety of aspects
and of physical conditions. The Po, the Rhone, the Rhine, and the Danube
traverse countries having the most diverse climates, and yet they have their
sources in the same mountain region, and the fertilising alluvium which they
deposit in their valleys results from the disintegration of the same rocks. Minor
valleys cut up the slopes of the Alps and of their dependent chains, and carry
towards the sea the waters of the mountains and the triturated fragments of their
rocks. Running waters are visible, wherever we cast our eyes. There are
neither deserts, nor sterile plateaux, nor inland lakes and river basins such as we
meet with in Africa and Asia. The rivers of Europe are not flooded as are those
of certain portions of South America, which deluge half the country with water.
On the contrary, in the scheme of her rivers Europe exhibits a certain degree of
moderation which has favoured the work of the settler, and facilitated the rise of
a local civilisation in each river basin. Moreover, although most rivers are sufficiently
large to have retarded migration, they are not sufficiently so to have
arrested it for any length of time. Even when roads and bridges did not exist,
barbarian immigrants easily made their way from the shores of the Black Sea to
those of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>But Europe, in addition to the advantages due to its framework of mountains
and the disposition of its river basins, enjoys the still greater advantage of possessing
an indented coast-line. It is mainly the contours of its coasts which impart to
Europe its double character of unity and diversity, which distinguish it amongst
continents. It is “one” because of its great central mass, and “diversified”
because of its numerous peninsulas and dependent islands. It is an organism, if
we may say so, resembling a huge body furnished with limbs. Strabo compared
Europe to a dragon. The geographers of the period of the revival of letters
compared it to a crowned virgin, Spain being the head, France the heart, and
England and Italy the hands, holding the sceptre and the orb. Russia, at that
time hardly known, is made to do duty for the ample folds of the robe.</p>

<p>The area of Europe is only half that of South America, and one-third of that
of Africa, and yet the development of its coast-lines is superior to that of the two
continents taken together. In proportion to its area the coasts of Europe have
twice the extent of those of South America, Australia, and Africa; and although
they are to a small extent inferior to those of North America, it must be borne
in mind that the arctic coasts of the latter are ice-bound during the greater
portion of the year. A glance at the subjoined diagrams will show that Europe,
as compared with the two other continents washed by the Arctic Ocean, enjoys the
immense advantage of possessing a coast-line almost wholly available for purposes
of navigation, whilst a large portion of the coasts of Asia and America is altogether
useless to man. And not only does the sea penetrate into
the very heart of <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
temperate Europe, cutting it up into elongated peninsulas, but these peninsulas,
too, are fringed with gulfs and miniature inland seas. The coasts of Greece, of
Thessaly, and of Thrace are thus indented by bays and gulfs, penetrating far into
the land; Italy and Spain likewise possess numerous bays and gulfs; and the
peninsulas of Northern Europe, Jutland and Scandinavia, are cut up by the
waters of the ocean into numerous secondary peninsulas.</p>

 being in reality only a peninsula of Asia, hardly admits of this
 comparison.</p></div></div><!--dctr-->

<p>The islands of Europe must be looked upon as dependencies of that continent,
for most of them are separated from it only by shallow seas. Candia and the
islands scattered broadcast over the Ægean Sea, the Archipelagos of the Ionian
Sea, and of Dalmatia, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia, Elba, and the Baleares, are in
reality but prolongations, or maritime out-stations, of neighbouring peninsulas. To
the islands of Sealand and Fyen, at the entrance to
the Baltic, Denmark owes <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
most of her commercial and political importance. Great Britain and Ireland,
which actually formed a portion of the European continent in a past age, cannot
be looked upon otherwise than as dependencies of it, although the isthmus which
once joined them has been destroyed by the waters of the ocean. England has
actually become the grand commercial emporium of Europe, and plays now the
same part in the world’s commerce that Greece once played in that of the more
restricted world of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that each of the European peninsulas should have
enjoyed in turn a period of commercial preponderance. Greece, the “most noble
individuality of the world of the ancients,” came first, and when at the height of
her power governed the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, which at that time meant nearly the whole
universe. During the Middle Ages Amalfi, Genoa, and Venice became the commercial
agents between Europe and the Indies. The discovery of a passage round
the Cape and of America diverted the world’s commerce to Cadiz, Seville, and
Lisbon, on the Iberian peninsula. Subsequently the merchants of the small
Dutch Republic seized a portion of the heritage of Spain and Portugal, and the
wealth of the entire world was floated into the harbours of their sea-bound islands
and peninsulas. In our own days Great Britain, thanks to its favourable geographical
position, in the very centre of great continental masses, and the energy
of its people, has become the great mart of the world. London, the most populous
city of the world, is also the great centre of attraction for the treasures of mankind;
but there can be no doubt that sooner or later it will be supplanted, in
consequence of the opening of new commercial high-roads, and changes in the
political preponderance of nations. Perhaps some city of the United States will
take the place of London in a future age, and thus the American belief in the
westward march of civilisation will be verified; or we may possibly return to the
East, and convert Constantinople or Cairo into the world’s emporium and centre of
intercourse.</p>

<p>But, whatever may happen in the future, the great changes which have taken
place in the relative importance of the peninsulas and islands of Europe in the
short span of twenty centuries, sufficiently prove that geographical features
exercise a varying influence at different epochs. That which at one time was
looked upon as a great natural advantage may become, in course of time, a serious
disadvantage. Thus the numerous inlets and gulfs enclosed by mountain chains,
which favoured the rise of the cities of Greece, and gave to Athens the dominion
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, now constitute as many obstacles to their connection with
the existing system of European communications. That which in former times
constituted the strength of the country has become its weakness. In primitive
times, before man ventured upon the seas, these bays and gulfs formed insurmountable
obstacles to the migration of nations; at a later date, when the art of
navigation had been acquired, they became commercial high-roads, and were
favourable to the development of civilisation; and at the present time they are
again obstacles in the way of our
road-builders and railway engineers. <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 title="V.—Climate.">V.—<span
 class="smcap">C<b>LIMATE.</b></span></h3></div>

<p class="pfirst">The
influence exercised by the relief of the land and the configuration of the
coasts varies in different ages, but that of climate is permanent. In this respect
Europe is the most favoured region of the earth, for during a cycle of unknown
length it has enjoyed a climate at once the most temperate, the most equable, and
the most healthy of all continents.</p>

<p>Owing to the inland seas which penetrate far into the land, the whole of
Europe is exposed to the modifying influence of the ocean. With the exception
of Central Russia, no part of Europe is more than 400 miles from the sea, and, as
most of the mountains slope from the centre of the continent towards its circumference,
the influence of the sea breezes is felt throughout. And thus continental
Europe, in spite of its great extent, enjoys the advantages of an insular climate
throughout, the winds passing over the ocean moderating the heat of summer and
tempering the cold of winter.</p>

<p>The continuous north-easterly movement of the waters of the Atlantic likewise
has a favourable effect upon the climate of Europe. After having been heated by
a tropical sun in the Gulf of Mexico, the gulf-stream issues through the Strait of
Florida, and, spreading over the Atlantic, takes its course towards the coasts of
Europe. This enormous mass of warm water, equal in volume to twenty million
rivers as large as the Rhone, brings the warmth of southern latitudes to the
western and northern shores of Europe. Its influence is felt not only in the
maritime countries of Western Europe, but to some extent as far as the Caspian
and the Ural Mountains.</p>

<p>The currents of the air exercise as favourable an influence upon the climate of
Europe as do those of the ocean. The south-westerly winds predominating on the
coasts pass over the warm gulf-stream, and, on reaching Europe, they part with the
heat stored up by them between the tropics. The north-westerly, northerly, and
even north-easterly winds, which blow during a portion of the year, are less cold
than might be expected, for they, too, have to cross the warm waters of the gulf-stream.
And lastly, there is the Sahara, which elevates the temperature of a
portion of Europe.</p>

<p>The increase in temperature due to the combined influence of winds and
ocean currents amounts to 40° 50°, and even 60°, if we compare Europe with
other parts of the world lying under the same latitudes. Nowhere else, not even
on the western coast of North America, do the isothermals, or lines of equal annual
temperature, ascend so high towards the arctic regions. The inhabitants of
Europe, though they may live 900 to 1,200 miles farther away from the equator,
enjoy as mild a climate as do those of America, and the decrease of temperature
on going northward is far less rapid than in any other part of the globe. This
uniformity of temperature constitutes one of the most characteristic features of
Europe. The whole of it lies within the temperate region bounded by the
isothermal lines of 32° F. and 68° F., whilst in America and Asia that privileged
zone has only half this extent. <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span></p>

<p>This remarkable uniformity in the climate of Europe is exhibited not only in
its temperature, but likewise in the distribution of its rains. The seas washing
the shores of Europe supply all parts of it with the necessary amount of moisture.
There is no rainless district, nor, with the exception of a portion of the maritime
region of the Caspian and a small corner of Spain, any district where droughts
occasionally entail the entire loss of the harvest. Rains fall not only regularly
every year, but in most countries they occur in every season, the only exception
being the countries of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, where autumn and winter are the real
rainy seasons. Moreover, in spite of the great diversity in the physical features of
Europe, the amount of rain is scarcely anywhere excessive, whether it descends as
a fine drizzle, as in Ireland, or in heavy showers, as in Provence and on the
southern slope of the Alps. The annual rainfall scarcely ever exceeds thirty-nine
inches, except on the flanks of certain mountain ranges which arrest the passage
of currents charged with moisture. This uniformity and moderation in the rainfall
exercise a regulating influence upon the course of the rivers, for even the
smallest amongst them, at all events those to the north of the Pyrenees, the Alps,
and the Balkan, flow throughout the year. They rise and fall generally within
narrow limits, and inundations on a vast scale are as rare as is want of water for
purposes of irrigation. In consequence of this regularity, Europe is able to derive
a greater advantage from its waters than other continents where the amount of
precipitation is more considerable. The Alps
contribute much towards <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
maintaining a regular flow of the rivers; the excess of humidity which falls to their
share is stored up in the shape of snow and ice, which descend slowly into the
valleys, and melt during the heat of summer. This happens just at a time when
the rivers gain least from rain, and lose most by evaporation, and some amongst
them would dry up if the ice of the mountains did not come to the aid of the
waters descending from the sky. It is thus that a sort of balance is established in
the economy of European rivers.</p>

<p>The climate of Europe is thus characterized by uniformity as a whole, and by a
compensatory action in its contrasts. Regularity and freedom from excess, such
as are not known in other continents, mark its ocean currents, its winds, its
temperature and rains, and the course of its rivers. These great advantages
have benefited its inhabitants in the past, and will not cease to do so in the
future. Though small in extent, Europe possesses by far the largest area of
acclimation. Man may migrate from Russia to Spain, or from Ireland to Greece,
without exposing himself to any great risk of life. The inhabitants of the
Caucasus and the Ural Mountains were thus able to cross the plains and mountains
of Europe, and to establish themselves on the shores of the Atlantic. Soil and
climate are equally propitious to man, and enable him to preserve his physical and
intellectual powers wherever he goes. A migratory people might found new
homesteads in any part of Europe. Their companions of travel—the dog, the
horse, and the ox—would not desert them on the road, and the seed-corn which
they carry with them would yield a harvest wherever confided to the earth.</p>

<p class="pfirst">A
study of the soil and a patient observation of climatic phenomena enable us
to appreciate the general influence exercised by the nature of the country upon
the development of its inhabitants; but it is more difficult to assign to each race
or nation its due share in the progress of European civilisation. No doubt, in
their struggles for existence, different groups of naked and ignorant savages must
have been acted upon differently, according to their numbers and physical strength,
their inborn intelligence, their tastes and mental tendencies. But who were those
primitive men who first turned to account the natural resources of the country in
which they dwelt? We know not; for, if we go back for a few thousand years,
every fact is shrouded in darkness. We know nothing even as regards the origin
of the leading nations of Europe. Are we the “sons of the soil,” and the “shoots
of oak-trees,” as told in the poetical language of ancient tradition, or are we to
look upon the inhabitants of Asia as the ancestors to whom we are indebted for
our languages, and for the rudiments of our arts and sciences? Or did those
immigrants from a neighbouring continent settle down amongst an indigenous
population? Not many years ago the Asiatic origin of European nations was
accepted as an established fact, and the original seats of our forefathers were
pointed out upon the map of Asia. But now most men of science
are agreed to <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
seek our ancestors upon the very soil which we, their descendants, still occupy.
Caverns, the shores of oceans and lakes, and the alluvial beds of our rivers have
yielded the remains of human industry, and even human skeletons, which clearly
prove that long before these supposed immigrations from Asia there existed in
Europe tribes who had already made some progress in human industry. Even in
the childhood of history there existed tribes who were looked upon as aborigines, and
some of their descendants—as, for instance, the Basks—have nothing in common
with the invaders from the neighbouring continent. Nor is it universally admitted
that the Aryans—that is, the ancestors of the Pelasgians, the Greeks, the Latins,
Celts, Germans, and Slavs—are of Asiatic origin. Similarity of language may
justify our belief in the common origin of the Aryans of Europe, the Persians, and
the Hindoos, but it does not prove that their ancestral home should be looked for
somewhere near the sources of the Oxus. Many men of learning<a class="afnanch" href="#fn3" id="fnanch3">3</a> look upon the
Aryans as aborigines of Europe, but certainty on this point does not exist. No
doubt, in prehistoric times, intermigrations between the two continents were
frequent; but we hardly know what directions they took, and can speak with
certainty only of those migrations of peoples which are related by history. We
thus know that Europe sent forth to other continents Galatians, Macedonians, and
Greeks, and more recently innumerable emigrants of all nationalities, and received
in turn Huns, Avares, Turks, Mongols, Circassians, Jews, Armenians, Moors,
Berbers, and members of many other nations.</p>

 ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAP OF EUROPE</div>

</div><!--dctr-->

<p>Leaving out of consideration the smaller families of nations, as well as the
members of races who have not attained a national existence, Europe may
be described as consisting of three great ethnological divisions, the principal
boundary between which is formed by the Alps, the Carpathians, and the
Balkan.</p>

<p>The first of these great families of European nations, the members of which
speak Greco-Latin languages, occupies the southern slopes of the Balkan and of the
Alps, the Iberian peninsula, France, and a portion of Belgium, as well as a few
detached territories within the limits of the ancient Roman empire, altogether
surrounded by alien nations. Such are the plains of the Lower Danube and a
portion of Transylvania, which are inhabited by the Rumanians, and a few
secluded Alpine valleys inhabited by “Romans.” On the other hand, fragments
of two ancient nations have maintained their ground in the midst of Latinised
populations, viz. the Celtic inhabitants of Brittany, and the Basks of the Pyrenees.
Generally speaking, however, all the inhabitants of South-western Europe, whether
of Celtic, Iberian, or Ligurian race, speak languages derived from the Latin, and
whatever differences existed originally between these various populations, this
community of language has more or less obliterated them.</p>

<p>The Teutonic nations form the second great group. They occupy nearly the
whole of Central Europe to the north of the Alps, and extend through Holland and
Flanders to within a short distance of the Straits of Dover. Denmark and the
great Scandinavian peninsula, as well as Iceland, belong
to the same group, and <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
the bulk of the inhabitants of the British Islands are likewise generally included
in it. The latter, however, should rather be described as a mixed race, for the
aboriginal Celtic population of these islands, which now exists pure only in a few
remote districts, has amalgamated with Anglo-Saxon and Danish invaders, and
the language of the latter has become mixed with mediæval French, the
resulting idiom being almost as much Latin as Saxon. The development of
national characteristics has been favoured by the isolation in which the inhabitants
of the British Islands found themselves, and they differ essentially from
continental neighbours—the Scandinavians, Germans, and Celto-Latins—in language
and customs.</p>

<p>The Slavs, or Slavonians, form the third group of European nations. They are
less numerous than the Greco-Latins, but the territories they occupy are far more
extensive, for they spread over nearly the whole of Russia, over Poland, a large
portion of the Balkan peninsula, and about one-half of the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy. All the great plains to the east of the Carpathians are inhabited by
Slavs, either pure or mixed with Tartars and Mongols. To the west and south
of the mountains the race is split up into numerous small nations, and in the
valley of the Danube these come into contact with Rumanians, as well as with
Turks and Magyars, the two latter being of Asiatic origin, and these separate the
Slavonians of the north from the Slavonians of the south. In the north, Finns,
Livonians, and Lithuanians interpose between the Slavonians and the Germanic
nations.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn4" id="fnanch4">4</a></p>

<p>Race and language, however, are not always identical. Members of one race
frequently speak the language of another, and race and linguistic boundaries,
therefore, differ frequently. As for the political boundaries, they scarcely ever
follow those natural features which would have been selected had their settlement
been intrusted to the spontaneous action of the different nations. They hardly
ever coincide with the boundaries of races or of languages, except in the case of a
few high mountain ranges or of arms of the sea. On many occasions the countries
of Europe were arbitrarily split up in consequence of wars or diplomatic arrangements.
A few peoples only, protected by the nature of their
country as well as <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
by their valour, have maintained their independence since the age of great migrations,
but many more have been swept away by successive invasions. Many others,
again, have alternately seen their frontiers expand and contract more than once
even during a generation.</p>

<p>The so-called “balance of European powers,” founded as it is upon the rights
of war and ambitious rivalries between nations, is necessarily unstable. Nations
eminently fit to lead a common political existence are torn asunder on the one
side, whilst the most heterogeneous elements are thrown together on the other. In
these political arrangements the nations themselves are never consulted, but their
wishes and inclinations must nevertheless prevail in the end, and the artificial
edifice raised by warriors and statesmen will come to the ground. A true
“balance of power” will only be established when every nation of the continent
shall have become the arbiter of its own destinies, when every pretended right of
conquest shall have been surrendered, and neighbouring nations shall be at liberty
to combine for the management of the affairs they have in common. Our arbitrary
political divisions, therefore, possess but a transitory value. They cannot altogether
be ignored; but in the following descriptions we shall, as far as possible, adhere
to the great natural divisions as defined by mountains and valleys, and by the
distribution of nations having the same origin and speaking the same language.
But even these natural boundaries lose their importance in countries like
Switzerland, inhabited by nations speaking different languages, but held together
by the strongest of all ties—the common enjoyment of freedom.</p>

<p>From an historical point of view a description of Europe should commence with
the maritime countries of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. It was Greece which gave birth to
our European civilisation, and which at one time occupied the centre of the known
world. Her poets first sang the praises of venturesome navigators, and her
historians and philosophers collected and classified the information received with
respect to foreign countries. In a subsequent age, Italy, in the very centre of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean, took the place of Greece, and for fifteen centuries maintained
herself therein: Genoa, Venice, and Florence succeeded Rome as the leaders of
the civilised world. During that period the surrounding nations gravitated
towards the Me­di­ter­ra­nean and Italy; and it was only when the Italians
themselves enlarged the terrestrial sphere by the discovery of a new world beyond
the ocean that this preponderance passed away from them, to remain for a short
time with the Iberian peninsula. Greece had been the mediator between Europe
and the ancient civilisations of Asia and Africa; Spain and Portugal became the
representatives of Europe in America and the extreme Orient; historical development
in its progress had followed the axis of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean from east to west.</p>

<p>It will be found natural, under these circumstances, when we describe the three
Me­di­ter­ra­nean peninsulas in the same volume, particularly as they are peopled
almost exclusively by Greco-Latin nations. France, though likewise Latinised,
nevertheless occupies a distinct position. It is a Me­di­ter­ra­nean country only as
respects Provence and Languedoc, the rest of its territory sloping towards the
Atlantic. Its geographical position and history have made
France the great <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
European thoroughfare upon which the nations of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean and of the
Atlantic meet to exchange their products and to fight their battles. Ideas are
imported into France from all parts of Europe, and she is called upon to act the
part of an interpreter between the nations of the North and of the South. Next to
France we shall describe the Germanic countries of Europe, the British Islands,
and Scandinavia; and lastly, the immense empire of Russia.</p>

and its insular satellites prove sufficiently that the unstable
floods of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean have exercised a greater influence upon
the march of history than did the solid land upon which man trod.
Western civilisation would never have seen the light had not the
waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean washed the shores of Egypt, Phœnicia,
Asia Minor, Hellas, Italy, Spain, and Carthage. The western nations would have
remained in their primitive barbarism if it had not been for the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
which joined Europe, Asia, and Africa; facilitated the intercourse between Aryans,
Semites, and Berbers; and rendered more equable the climate of the surrounding
countries, thus facilitating access to them. For ages it appeared almost as if mankind
could prosper only in the neighbourhood of this central sea, for beyond its
basin only decayed nations were to be met with, or tribes not yet awakened to mental
activity. “Like frogs around a swamp, so have we settled down on the shores of
this sea,” said Plato; and the sea he refers to is the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. It is therefore
deserving of description quite as much as the inhabited countries which surround
it. Unfortunately many mysteries still remain hidden beneath its waves.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn5" id="fnanch5">5</a></p>

<p>From an examination of the coasts, as well as from the traditions of the people
inhabiting them, we learn that the Me­di­ter­ra­nean has varied frequently in its
contours and extent. The straits which connect its waters with those of the
ocean have frequently changed their position. At a time when peninsulas like
Greece, and even islands like Malta, formed part of continental masses—and that
they did so in a comparatively recent geological epoch is proved by their fossil
fauna—the waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean covered large portions of Africa, of
Southern Russia, and even of Asia. The researches of Spratt, Fuchs, and others
have satisfactorily proved that towards the close of the miocene
age a vast <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
fresh-water lake stretched from the banks of the Aral, across Russia, the plains of the
Danube and the Archipelago, as far as Syracuse in Sicily. Then came the briny
waters of the ocean. There was a time when the Black Sea and the Caspian
connected the Archipelago with the Gulf of the Obi. At another epoch the gulfs
of the Syrtes penetrated far inland, and a large portion of what is now the Libyan
and Saharan desert was then covered with water. The Strait of Gibraltar, which
was torn asunder by Hercules according to the traditions of the ancients, is in
reality but of recent origin, and has taken the place of a more ancient strait which
joined the Me­di­ter­ra­nean to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean: this strait has been
restored by human hands, and is known now as the Suez Canal. The coast-lines of
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean are undergoing perpetual change, owing to the upheaval or
subsidence of the countries surrounding it. The Nile, the Po, the Rhone, and
other rivers incessantly enlarge the alluvial plains at their mouths, and still
further encroach upon the sea. Actually the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, with its subordinate
seas from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Sea of Azof, covers an area about thirty
times that of the British Islands. This area is small if we compare it with the
immense development of the coasts and the wealth in peninsulas, which impart an
aspect of life and independence to at least one-third of the ancient world. The
Me­di­ter­ra­nean, though it takes precedence of all the oceans, in consequence of the
part it has played in history, nevertheless only covers an area one-seventieth that
of the Pacific.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn6" id="fnanch6">6</a> It is broken up, moreover, into several separate seas, some of them
so small in extent that the navigator hardly ever loses sight
of the land. In the <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
east we have the Black Sea, with its two dependencies, the Seas of Azof and of
Marmara. The Ægean Sea, or Archipelago, with its numerous islands, extends
between the deeply indented coasts of Greece, Asia Minor, and Crete. The
Adriatic stretches towards the north-west, between the Balkan peninsula and
Italy; and the Me­di­ter­ra­nean proper is divided into two separate basins, which
might appropriately be called the Phœnician and Carthaginian Seas, or the Greek
and Roman Me­di­ter­ra­neans. Each of these basins is again subdivided, the one by
Crete, the other by the two islands of Sardinia and Corsica. These various
subdivisions of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean differ in area, and still more in depth. The Sea
of Azof almost deserves the name of “Swamp,” which was bestowed upon it by
the ancients, for if a ship sinks in it the masts remain visible above the water.
The Black Sea has a maximum depth of over 1,000 fathoms, but the narrow strait
which joins it to the Sea of Marmara is shallower than many a European river.
The cavity filled by the Sea of Marmara is far inferior to that of many an inland
lake; and the Dardanelles, like the Bosphorus, are hardly wider than a river. In
the Archipelago and the eastern basin of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean proper the depth
corresponds with the protuberance of the land. Abyssal depths and “pits” of 260
and even of 540 fathoms are to be found in close proximity to the scarped
mountain islands of the Cyclades, whilst on the low coasts of Egypt the water
deepens only gradually, until in the centre of the Levantine Sea it attains a depth
of 1,750 fathoms. The maximum depth—2,170 fathoms—is attained between
Crete and Malta. If the whole of the waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean were to be
collected into an aqueous sphere, the latter would have a diameter of 90 miles;
if it fell down upon the earth, it would not even wholly cover a country like
Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Ionian Sea is separated from the Adriatic by a submarine ridge rising in
the Strait of Otranto, and bounded on the west by a shoal or submarine isthmus,
already referred to by Strabo, which joins Sicily to Tunis. This isthmus forms
the true geological boundary between the western and eastern basins of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean, which are connected here by a narrow breach only, the depth of
which hardly exceeds 100 fathoms. The western of these basins is the smaller and
shallower of the two, but nevertheless it attains a depth of 1,100 fathoms in the
Tyrrhenian, and of 1,360 fathoms and even 1,640 in the Balearic Sea, and is
separated from the waters of the Atlantic by a submarine ridge lying outside the
Strait of Gibraltar, and joining Europe to Africa.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn7" id="fnanch7">7</a></p>

<p>This subdivision of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean into separate basins, divided from each
other by shoals or submarine ridges, by islands and promontories, sufficiently
explains the contrasts between the phenomena of the open ocean and those observed
here. In the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, it is well known, the tides are almost everywhere
irregular and uncertain. To the east of the Narrows of Gibraltar, in the sea
extending between Andalusia and Morocco, the tides are hardly
felt at all, and <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
they are, moreover, interfered with to such an extent by currents that it is exceedingly
difficult to determine their amplitude, or the establishment of the various
ports. Nevertheless the rise and fall of the tidal wave are sufficiently marked to
have attracted the attention of Greek and Italian navigators. On the coasts of
Catalonia, France, Liguria, Naples, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt the oscillation
is hardly perceptible, but on those of Eastern Sicily and of the Adriatic the tide
sometimes rises three feet, and, if accompanied by storms, may even attain a height
of ten feet in certain localities. The Straits of Messina and of Euripo (Eubœa) have
their regular tides, and in the Gulf of Gabes the waters rise and fall with the same
regularity as in the open ocean. In the Black Sea, however, no tidal movements
whatever have been discovered hitherto. It is nevertheless probable that more
careful observations will lead to the discovery of a feeble tide, for it is believed
that this phenomenon exists even on Lake Michigan, which has only one-fifth the
area of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The Me­di­ter­ra­nean differs not only from the open ocean with respect to the
feebleness and irregularity of its tides, but it is likewise without a great
stream-current
keeping in constant circulation the whole body of its waters. The currents
which have been observed in various divisions of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean can be ascribed
only to local causes. An Italian geographer of the last
century, Montanari, has <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
advanced an hypothesis of a great circuit current which entered the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
through the Strait of Gibraltar, and, after having washed the shores of Africa as
far as Egypt, returned to the west along those of Asia and Europe; but careful
observers have vainly endeavoured to discover its existence. They have met only
with local currents, produced by an indraught of the waters of the Atlantic, by
winds, by the floods of rivers, or by an excess of evaporation. One of these
currents sets along the coasts of Morocco and Algeria from west to east; another
flows along the Italian coast of the Adriatic from north to south; and a third
from the mouth of the Rhone in the direction of Cette and Port Vendres. In
fact, the configuration of the sea-bottom, and particularly the shoal between Sicily
and Tunis, precludes the existence of any but surface currents in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.</p>

<p>Amongst the local currents the existence of which has been most clearly
established are those which convey the waters of the Sea of Azof into the Black
Sea, and those of the latter into the Archipelago. The Don more than makes up
for the loss by evaporation in the Sea of Azof, and its surplus waters find an exit
through the Strait of Kerch into the Black Sea. Similarly the waters of the
Dniester, the Dnieper, the Rion, and of the rivers of Asia Minor, and, above all, of
the Danube, which by itself conveys a larger volume of water into the Black Sea
than all the others combined, are discharged through the Bosphorus and the
Dardanelles into the Archipelago. On the other hand, the Archipelago returns to
the Black Sea, by means of a submarine counter-current and of lateral surface
currents, a certain quantity of salt water for the fresh water which it receives in
excess. This exchange accounts for the salineness of the waters of the Black
Sea. The volume of fresh water discharged into it by the Danube and other
rivers is so large that in the course of a thousand years its waters would become
perfectly fresh, if there did not exist these compensatory highly saline counter-currents.</p>

<p>Analogous phenomena take place at the other extremity of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.
Evaporation there is excessive, owing to the neighbourhood of the burning sands
of the deserts, the winds from which blow freely over the sea, absorbing the
vapours and dispersing the clouds. The loss by evaporation amounts to at least
seven feet in the course of a year, and as the annual rainfall is estimated to amount
to twenty inches only, and the volume of water discharged annually by all the
tributary rivers of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, if uniformly spread over its surface, would
hardly exceed ten inches in depth, there exists thus an excess of evaporation
amounting annually to more than four feet; and this excess has to be made good
by an inflow of the waters of the Atlantic, which takes place through the Strait of
Gibraltar, whose volume far exceeds that of the Amazon in a state of flood. This
inflow of the waters of the Atlantic is felt, as a current, as far as the coasts of
Sicily, and, like all other currents, it is bounded by lateral currents flowing in a
direction contrary to that of the main current. During ebb the insetting Atlantic
current takes up the whole of the strait, but when the tide rises the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
resists more successfully the pressure of the ocean, and this struggle
gives birth to <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
two counter-currents, one of which skirts the coast of Europe, the other that of
Africa between Ceuta and Cape Spartel; the latter is the larger and more powerful
of the two. In addition to these, there exists a submarine current, which conveys
the highly saline and heavier waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean out into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The quantity of salt held in solution in various parts of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
differs widely, as the submarine ridges and shoals which divide it into separate
basins do not permit its waters to mingle as freely as in the open ocean. Owing
to the excess of evaporation, the quantity of salt is greater on the whole than in the
Atlantic, and this is the case more particularly on the coast of Africa. But in the
Black Sea it is far less, and near the mouths of some of the large rivers which
enter that sea the water is almost fresh.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn8" id="fnanch8">8</a></p>

<p>The temperature of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean is affected by the same causes which
produce its varying salineness, viz. the existence of shoals and banks, which
separate it into distinct sub-basins. In the open ocean the currents convey to all
latitudes large bodies of water, some of them heated by a tropical sun, others cooled
by contact with the ice of the polar regions. But these layers of unequal density
are regularly superimposed one upon the other, owing to the differences in their
temperature: the warm water remains on the surface, whilst the cold water
descends to the bottom. In the Me­di­ter­ra­nean an analogous superimposition
exists only to a depth of 110 fathoms, which is the depth of the Atlantic current,
flowing into it through the Strait of Gibraltar. If a thermometer be lowered to a
greater depth it will indicate no further decrease of temperature, and the immense
body of water, remaining almost still at the bottom of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, has an
equable temperature of about 56° F. Observations made at depths varying
between 110 and 1,640 fathoms have always exhibited the same result. Professor
Carpenter believes, however, that the abyssal waters of some of the volcanic regions
have a somewhat higher temperature, which may be due to the presence of lava in
a state of fusion.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Another remarkable feature of the abyssal waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean consists
in their poverty of animal life. No doubt there is some life; the dredgings of the
<i>Porcupine</i> and the telegraph cables, which, on being brought to the surface, were
found to be covered with shells and polypes, prove this. But, compared with those of
the ocean, the depths of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean are veritable deserts. Edward Forbes,
who explored the waters of the Archipelago, arrived at the conclusion that their
abyssal depths were entirely devoid of life, but he was wrong when he assumed an
exceptional case like this to represent a universal law. Carpenter thinks that
this absence of life in the depths of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean is due to the great quantity
of organic remains which is carried into it by the rivers. These remains absorb
the oxygen of the water, and part with their carbonic acid,
which is detrimental to <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
animal life. In numerous instances the water of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean contains only
one-fourth the normal quantity of the former gas, but fifty per cent. in excess of
the latter. To the presence of these organic remains the Me­di­ter­ra­nean is
probably indebted for its beautiful azure colour, so different from the black waters
of most oceans. This blue, then, which is justly celebrated by poets, would thus be
caused by the impurity of the water. M. Delesse has shown that the bottom of
nearly the whole of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean is covered with ooze.</p>

<p>The regions of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean immediately below the surface abound in animal
life, particularly on the coasts of Sicily and Southern Italy; but nearly all species,
whether fish, testacea, or others, are of Atlantic origin. The Me­di­ter­ra­nean, in
spite of its vast extent, as far as its fauna is concerned, is nothing but a gulf of the
Lusitanian Ocean. Its longitudinal extension and the similarity of climate in its
various portions have favoured the migration of animals through the Strait of
Gibraltar as far as the coasts of Syria. At the same time, animal life is most
varied near this point of entry, and the species met with in the western basin are
generally of greater size than those which exist in the eastern. A very small proportion
of non-Atlantic species recalls the fact that the Me­di­ter­ra­nean formerly
communicated with the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. But amongst a total of
more than eight hundred molluscs there are only about thirty which have reached
the seas of Greece and Sicily through the ancient straits separating Africa from
Asia, instead of through the Strait of Gibraltar.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn9" id="fnanch9">9</a> The diminution in the number
of species in an easterly direction becomes most striking when we reach the narrow
channel of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The Black Sea, in fact, differs
essentially from the Me­di­ter­ra­nean proper as regards temperature. It is refrigerated
by north-easterly winds sweeping over its surface, to the extent even of
portions of it becoming now and then covered with a thin coating of ice, adhering
to the coast. The Sea of Azof has frequently disappeared beneath a thick crust of
ice, and even the whole of the Black Sea has been frozen over in winters of
exceptional severity. The cold surface waters, together with those conveyed into
the Black Sea by large rivers, descend to the bottom, and prove most detrimental
to animal life. Echinodermata and zoophytes are not met with at all in the Black
Sea; certain classes of molluscs, already rare in the Levantine Sea and the
Archipelago, are likewise absent; and the total number of species of molluscs is
only one-tenth of what it is in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. Fish are numerous as far as
individuals go, but their species are few. In fact, the fauna of the Black Sea
appears to resemble that of the Caspian, from which it is cut off, rather than that
of the Greek seas, with which the Sea of Marmara connects it.</p>

<p>In addition to the species which have found a second home in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
there are some that must still be looked upon as visitors. Such are the sharks,
which extend their incursions to the seas of Sicily, to the Adriatic, and even to the
coasts of Egypt and Syria. Such, also, are the larger cetacea—whales, rorquals,
and sperm whales—whose visits, however, are confined
now to the Tyrrhenian <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
basin, and become less frequent from century to century. The tunny-fish of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean are also visitors from the coasts of Lusitania. First-rate swimmers,
they enter through the Strait of Gibraltar in spring, ascend the whole of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean, make the tour of the Black Sea, and return in autumn to the
Atlantic, after having accomplished a journey of some 5,600 miles. In the opinion
of the fishermen the tunnies go upon their travels in three immense divisions or
shoals, and it is the central shoal which visits the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea,
and consists of the largest and strongest fish. Each of the three divisions appears
to be composed of individuals about the same age. For mutual protection they
swim in troops, for they are preyed upon by enemies innumerable. Dolphins and
other fish of prey follow their track, but their great destroyer is man. In the
summer the tunny fishery, or <i>tonnaro</i>, is carried on in numerous bays of Sicily,
Sardinia, Naples, and of Provence. Enormous structures consisting of nets
enclose these bays, and they are ingeniously arranged so as to close gradually
around the captured fish, which, passing from net to net, find themselves at last in
the “chamber of death,” where they are massacred. Millions of pounds of flesh
are annually obtained from these floating “slaughter-houses,” yet the tunny
appears year after year in multitudes, and on the same coasts. There may have
been a slight decrease in the number, but their closely packed masses still invade
the “Golden Horn” of Byzance and other bays, as they did when first they
attracted the attention of Greek naturalists.</p>

<p>Next to the tunny fisheries those of the sardines and anchovies are most
important. Sea-urchins and other products of the sea are eaten by the inhabitants
of the coasts, particularly in Italy, but there is no part of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean where
animal life is so abundant and so prodigious in quantity as on the celebrated
banks of Newfoundland, or on the coasts of Portugal or of the Canaries.</p>

<p>A large number of fishing-boats are engaged, not in the capture of
fish, but in <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
the collection of articles of dress or of the toilet. The purple-shell fisheries on the
coasts of Phœnicia, the Peloponnesus, and Greece are no longer carried on, but
hundreds of boats are employed annually during the fine season in fishing for coral
or sponges.</p>

<p>Coral is found most abundantly in the western portion of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
and the Italian fishermen do not confine themselves to their own shores—to Sicily,
Naples, and Sardinia—but also visit the Strait of Bonifacio, the sea off St. Tropez,
the vicinity of Cape Creus in Spain, and the waters of Barbary. Ordinary
sponges are collected in the Gulf of Gabes, and at the other extremity of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean, on the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor, and in the straits winding
between the Cyclades and Sporades. Sponges are usually found at a depth of
from 12 to 150 feet, and can be gathered by divers; whilst coral occurs at far
greater depths, and has to be wrenched off with an iron instrument, which brings
up its fragments, mixed with ooze, seaweeds, and the remains of marine animalculæ.
This industry is still in a state of barbarism: those devoted to it are not as
yet sufficiently acquainted with the sea and its inhabitants to enable them to carry
on the sponge and coral fisheries in a rational manner. Yet this they must aim
at: they must learn how to deprive Proteus, the ever-changing deity, of his
dominion over the inhabitants of the deep.</p>

<p>Next to the fisheries, the preparation of sea salt constitutes one of the leading
industries of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean coast-lands. But this industry, too, is frequently
carried on in a primitive way, and only in the course of the present century have
scientific methods been introduced in connection with it. The Me­di­ter­ra­nean is
admirably suited for the production of salt, for its waters have a high temperature,
they hold a very large quantity of salt in solution, the rise and fall of the tides are
inconsiderable, and flat seashores alternate with steep coasts and promontories.
The most productive salt marshes of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean are probably those on the
Lagoon, or Étang de Thau, near Cette, and on the littoral of Hyères; but considerable
ones may also be met with on the coasts of Spain, in Italy, in Sardinia,
Sicily, Istria, and even on the “limans” of Bessarabia, bordering upon the Black
Sea. The annual production of salt is estimated at more than a million tons, and
exceeds, therefore, the entire tonnage of the commercial marine of France.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn10" id="fnanch10">10</a> But
this quantity, large as it is, is infinitesimal if we compare it with the saline
contents of the sea, and science will enable us one day to raise a far more abundant
treasure from its sterile depths.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn11" id="fnanch11">11</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">Whatever advantages may be yielded by fisheries and salt-works, they shrink
into insignificance if we compare them with the great
gain—material, intellectual, <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
and moral—which mankind has derived from the navigation of this inland sea.
It has repeatedly been pointed out by historians that the disposition of the coasts,
islands, and peninsulas of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean of the Phœnicians and Greeks admirably
favoured the first essays in maritime commerce. Many causes have contributed
to make this sea the cradle of European commerce: the faint summits of
distant lands visible even before the port has been quitted; numerous nooks along
the coasts where a safe refuge may be found in case of storms; regular land and
sea breezes; an equability of climate which makes the sailor feel at home wherever
business takes him; and, moreover, a great variety of productions resulting from
the diverse configuration of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean coast-lands. And this commerce,
does it not lead to a peaceful intercourse between peoples on neutral ground, and
to mutual enlightenment, brought about by an interchange of ideas? Every
coast-line which facilitates the intercourse between nations is, therefore, of immense
value as a means of developing civilisation.</p>

<p>Civilisation for many centuries marched from the south-east towards the north-west,
and Phœnicia, Greece, Italy, and France have successively become great
centres of human intelligence. This historical phenomenon is due to the configuration
of the sea, which has been the vehicle of migratory nations. In fact, the axis
of civilisation, if this expression be allowed, has become confounded with that axis
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean which extends from the coast of Syria to the Gulf of Lions,
on the coast of France. But the Me­di­ter­ra­nean has ceased to be the only centre of
gravitation of Europe, which sends its merchantmen now to the two Americas and
the farthest East; and civilisation no longer marches in that general line from east
to west, but rather radiates in all directions. Civilising streams depart from
England and Germany towards Northern America, and from the Latinised countries
of Europe towards Southern America. Their direction is still westerly, but they
have been deflected towards the south, to meet the conditions imposed by climate
and the geographical configuration of land and sea.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace the changes which have occurred in the historical
importance of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. As long as that sea remained the great highway
between nations, the commercial republics were content to extend this highway
towards the east, by establishing caravan routes to the Gulf of Persia, to India, and
to China. In the Middle Ages Genoese factories dotted the coasts of the Black Sea,
and extended thence through Trans-Caucasia as far as the Caspian. European
travellers, and particularly Italians, at that time crossed Western Asia in all
directions; and many a route hardly known in our days was then frequented almost
daily. But for several centuries direct commercial intercourse with Central Asia
has dwindled down to small proportions.</p>

<p>The Me­di­ter­ra­nean had ceased to be a great ocean highway. Our navigators,
no longer dreading a boundless sea, took their ships into every part of the ocean.
The difficult and perilous land routes were abandoned, the once busy markets of
Central Asia became solitudes, and the Me­di­ter­ra­nean itself a veritable blind alley,
as far as the world’s commerce was concerned. This condition of affairs lasted for
many years, but since the middle of this century our relations with
the East have <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
been renewed, and the lost ground is rapidly being recovered. Within the last
year a great commercial revolution has been effected through the opening of one
of the ancient gates of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and the Suez Canal has become the
great highway of steamers between Western Europe, the Indies, and Australia.
Possibly, at no distant future, a similar canal will enable our merchantmen to
proceed from the Black Sea to the Caspian, and perhaps even to the Amu and the
Syr, in the very heart of the ancient continent.</p>

<p>It is thus that the great centres of in­ter­com­mu­ni­ca­tion, or vital points of our
planet, as we should like to call them, become shifted in the course of time. Port
Said, an improvised town on a desert shore, has thus become a centre of attraction
for travellers and merchandise, whilst the neighbouring cities of Tyre and Sidon
have dwindled down into miserable villages, with nothing to indicate the proud
position they held in the past. Carthage, too, has perished, and Venice decayed.
Many a thriving place on the shores of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean has been reduced to
insignificance through the silting up of its harbour, the employment of larger
vessels, the loss of independence, or through political changes of all kinds. But
in nearly every instance some neighbouring town has taken the place of these
decayed harbours, and most of the great routes of commerce have maintained their
original directions, and their terminal points, as well as intermediate stations, have
remained in the same localities.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, certain places which ships are almost obliged to frequent,
and where towns of importance arise as a matter of course. Such are the Straits of
Gibraltar and of Messina; such, also, are places like Genoa, Trieste, and Saloniki,
which occupy the bottom of gulfs or bays penetrating far into the land. Ports
offering the greatest facilities for embarking merchandise intended for foreign
countries, such as Marseilles and Alexandria, are likewise natural centres of
attraction to merchants. One town there is in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean which enjoys at
one and the same time every one of the geographical advantages which we have
pointed out, for it is situated on a strait connecting two seas and separating two
continents. This town is Constantinople, and despite the deplorable mal­ad­mi­ni­stra­tion
under which it suffers, its position alone has enabled it to maintain its
place amongst the great cities of the world.</p>

<p>The ports of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean no longer enjoy a monopoly of commerce as
they did for thousands of years, but the number of ships to be met with in that
inland sea is, nevertheless, proportionately far greater than what we meet with on
the open oceans. The commercial marine of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean numbers thirty-seven
thousand vessels, of a capacity of two million seven hundred and ninety-six
thousand tons, without counting fishing-boats. This is more than one-fourth of
the entire commercial marine of the world, as respects the number of ships, and
one-sixth of it as regards tonnage. This inferiority of tonnage is due to the small
vessels of ancient types which still maintain their ground in Greece and Italy, and
which possess certain advantages for the coasting trade.</p>

<p>To this marine of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean should be added the vessels belonging to
foreign ports, which visit it for purposes of trade, and amongst
which those of <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
England take the most prominent rank. The Government of Great Britain has
even taken care to secure itself a place amongst the Me­di­ter­ra­nean powers. It has
occupied Gibraltar, at the eastern entrance to this basin, and taken possession of
Malta, which commands its centre; and although the western entrance, formed by
the Suez Canal, is not in its possession, its garrisons on Perim and the rock of Aden
are able at any moment to close up the only approach to it which leads from the
Indian Ocean through the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The share which England takes in the commerce of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean is
considerable, but it is surpassed by far by that of France and Italy. A sovereign
who aspired to the dominion of the world once spoke of the inland sea extending
from the Strait of Gibraltar to Egypt as a “French lake;” but with equal justice
might it be called a Greek, a Dalmatian, or Spanish lake, and with still greater
an Italian lake. The pirates of Barbary were, in reality, the last “masters” of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean: their swift vessels presented themselves unexpectedly before the
coast towns, and carried off their inhabitants. But since their predatory fleets
have been destroyed, the Me­di­ter­ra­nean has become the common property of the
world, and the meshes of an international network of maritime highways become
closer from year to year. The merchantmen no longer pursue their voyages in
company as they did in former times, discharging their cargo from port to port,
for a single vessel may venture now into any portion of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean in
safety. Still there remain the dangers of reefs and of storms. The art of navigation
has made vast progress; most of the capes, at least on the coasts of Europe, are
lit up by lighthouses; the approaches to the ports are rendered easy by lightships,
buoys, and beacons; but shipwrecks are nevertheless of frequent occurrence. Even
large vessels founder sometimes, without leaving a stray plank behind to indicate
the place of their disappearance.</p>

<p>Steamers travelling along prescribed routes are now gradually taking the
place of sailing vessels, and where they cross at frequent intervals
they may be <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
likened to ferry-boats crossing a river. The regularity and speed of these steam
ferries; the facilities which they afford for the conveyance of merchandise; the
increasing number of railways which convey the produce of the interior to the
seaports; and lastly, the submarine telegraphs, which have established instantaneous
means of communication between the principal ports, all contribute towards the
growth of Me­di­ter­ra­nean commerce. This commerce, including imports and
exports, and the transit through the Suez Canal, actually amounts to about
£353,000,000, a year.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn12" id="fnanch12">12</a> This may not be much for a maritime population of a
hundred millions, but a perceptible increase is taking place from year to year. We
should also bear in mind that, face to face with the busy peninsulas of Europe, there
lies torrid Africa, an inert mass, avoided by the sailors of our own age as much as
it was by those of ancient Greece. Its coasts are hardly ever visited, with the
exception of those portions which extend from Oran to Tunis, and from Alexandria
to Port Said. It is matter of surprise, too, that certain localities which formerly
attracted crowds of vessels, such as Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and beautiful Crete, at the
very entrance to the Archipelago, should still remain outside the ordinary track
of our steamers.</p>

within its confined political boundaries, to the south of the
Gulfs of Arta and Volo, is a country of about nineteen thousand
square miles, or at most equal to the ten-millionth part of the earth’s
surface. Within the vast empire of Russia there are many districts
more extensive than the whole of Greece, but there is nothing
which distinguishes these from other districts which surround them, and their names
call forth no idea in our mind. The little country of the Hellenes, however, so
insignificant upon our maps—how many memories does it not awaken&#x202f;! In no
other part of the world had man attained a degree of civilisation equally harmonious
in all respects, or more favourable to individual development. Even
now, though carried along within an historical cycle far more vast than that of
the Greeks, we should do well to look back frequently in order to contemplate
those small nations, who are still our masters in the arts, and first initiated us into
science. The city which was the “school of Greece” still remains the school of
the entire world; and after twenty centuries of decay, like some of those extinct
stars whose luminous rays yet reach the earth, still continues to enlighten us.</p>

<p>The considerable part played by the people of Greece during many ages must
undoubtedly be ascribed to the geographical position of their country. Other
tribes having the same origin, but inhabiting countries less happily situated—such,
for instance, as the Pelasgians of Illyria, who are believed to be the ancestors of
the Albanians—have never risen above a state of barbarism, whilst the Hellenes
placed themselves at the head of civilised nations, and opened fresh paths to their
enterprise. If Greece had remained for ever what it was during the tertiary
geological epoch—a vast plain attached to the deserts of Libya, and run over by
lions and the rhinoceros—would it have become the native country of a Phidias,
an Æschylos, or a Demosthenes? Certainly not. It would have shared the fate
of Africa, and, far from taking the initiative in civilisation, would have waited for
an impulse to be given to
it from beyond. <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span></p>

<p>Greece, a sub-peninsula of the peninsula of the Balkans, was even more
completely protected by transverse mountain barriers in the north than was
Thracia or Macedonia. Greek culture was thus able to develop itself without fear
of being stifled at its birth by successive invasions of barbarians. Mounts
Olympus, Pelion, and Ossa, towards the north and east of Thessaly, constituted the
first line of formidable obstacles towards Macedonia. A second barrier, the steep
range of the Othrys, runs along what is the present political boundary of Greece.
To the south of the Gulf of Lamia a fresh obstacle awaits us, for the range of the
Œta closes the passage, and there is but the narrow pass of the Thermopylæ
between it and the sea. Having crossed the mountains of the Locri and descended
into the basin of Thebæ, there still remain to be crossed the Parnes or the
spurs of the Cithæron before we reach the plains of Attica. The “isthmus”
beyond these is again defended by transverse barriers, outlying ramparts, as it
were, of the mountain citadel of the Peloponnesus, that acropolis of all Greece.
Hellas has frequently been compared to a series of chambers, the doors of which
were strongly bolted; it was difficult to get in, but more difficult to get out again,
owing to their stout defenders. Michelet likens Greece to a trap having three
compartments. You entered, and found yourself taken first in Macedonia, then in
Thessaly, then between the Thermopylæ and the isthmus. But the difficulties
increase beyond the isthmus, and Lacedæmonia remained impregnable for a long
time.</p>

<p>At an epoch when the navigation even of a land-locked sea like the Ægean
was attended with danger, Greece found herself sufficiently protected against the
invasions of oriental nations; but, at the same time, no other country held out such
inducements to the pacific expeditions of merchants. Gulfs and harbours facilitated
access to her Ægean coasts, and the numerous outlying islands were available
as stations or as places of refuge. Greece, therefore, was favourably placed for
entering into commercial intercourse with the more highly civilised peoples who
dwelt on the opposite coasts of Asia Minor. The colonists and voyagers of Eastern
Ionia not only supplied their Achæan and Pelasgian kinsmen with foreign commodities
and merchandise, but they also imparted to them the myths, the poetry,
the sciences, and the arts of their native country. Indeed, the geographical
configuration of Greece points towards the east, whence she has received her first
enlightenment. Her peninsulas and outlying islands extend in that direction; the
harbours on her eastern coasts are most commodious, and afford the best shelter;
and the mountain-surrounded plains there offer the best sites for populous cities.
Greece, at the same time, does not share the disadvantage of Turkey, which is
almost cut off from the western world by a mountain region difficult to cross.
The Ionian Sea, to the west of the Peloponnesus, it is true, is, comparatively
speaking, a desert; but farther north the Gulf of Corinth almost cuts in two the
Greek peninsula, and the sight of the distant mountains of Italy, which are visible
from the Ionian Islands, must have incited to an exploration of the western seas.
The Acarnanians, who knew how to build vaults long before the Romans, were
thus brought early into contact with the Italians, to whom
they imparted their <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
knowledge, and at a subsequent period the Greeks became the civilisers of the
whole western world of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.</p>

<p>The most distinctive feature of Hellas, as far as concerns the relief of the
ground, consists in the large number of small basins, separated one from the other
by rocks or mountain ramparts. The features of the ground thus favoured the
division of the Greek people into a multitude of independent republics. Every
town had its river, its amphitheatre of hills or mountains, its acropolis, its fields,
pastures, and forests, and nearly all of them had, likewise, access to the sea. All
the elements required by a free community were thus to be found within each of
these small districts, and the neighbourhood of other towns, equally favoured, kept
alive perpetual emulation, too frequently degenerating into strife and battle. The
islands of the Ægean Sea, likewise, had constituted themselves into miniature
republics. Local institutions thus developed themselves freely, and even the
smallest island of the Archipelago has its great representatives in history.</p>

<p>But whilst there thus exists the greatest diversity, owing to the configuration
of the ground and the multitude of islands, the sea acts as a binding element,
washes every coast, and penetrates far inland. These gulfs and numerous harbours
have made the maritime inhabitants of Greece a nation of sailors—amphibiæ, as
Strabo called them. From the most remote times the passion for travel has always
been strong amongst them. When the inhabitants of a town grew too numerous
to support themselves upon the produce of their land, they swarmed out like bees,
explored the coasts of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and, when they had found a site which
recalled their native home, they built themselves a new city. It was thus Greek
cities arose in hundreds of places, from the Mæotis Palus to beyond the columns of
Hercules—from Tanais and Panticapæum to Gades and Tingis, the modern Tangier.
Thanks to those numerous colonies, some of them more powerful and renowned than
the mother towns which gave birth to them, the veritable Greece, the Greece of
science and art and republican independence, in the end overflowed its ancient
cradle, and sporadically occupied the whole circumference of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.
The Greeks held the same position relatively to the world of the ancients which
is occupied at the present time by the Anglo-Saxons with reference to the entire
earth. There exists, indeed, a remarkable analogy between Greece, with its archipelago,
and the British Islands, at the other extremity of the continent. Similar
geographical advantages have brought about similar results, as far as commerce
is concerned, and between the Ægean and the British seas time and space have
effected a sort of harmony.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The admiration with which travellers behold Greece is due, above all, to the
memories attaching to every one of its ruins, to the smallest amongst its rivulets,
and the most insignificant rock in its seas. Scenery in Provence or Spain, though
it may surpass in grace or boldness of outline anything to be seen in Greece, is
appreciated only by a few. The mass go past it without emotion, for names like
Marathon, Leuctra, or Platææ are not connected with it, and the rustle of bygone
ages is not heard. But even if glorious memories were not
associated with the <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
coasts of Greece, their beauty would nevertheless entitle them to our admiration.
In the gulfs of Athens or of Argos the artist is charmed not only with the azure
blue of the waters, the transparency of the sky, the ever-changing perspective
along the shores, and the boldness of the promontories, but also with the pure and
graceful profile of the mountains, which consist of layers of limestone or of marble.
We almost fancy we look upon architectural piles; and the temples with which
many a summit is adorned appear to epitomize them.</p>

<p>It is verdure and the sparkling water of rivulets which we miss most on the
shores of Greece. Nearly all the mountains near the coast have been despoiled of
their large trees. There remain only bushes, mastic, strawberry, and juniper
trees, and evergreen oaks; even the carpet of odoriferous herbs which clothes the
declivities, and upon which the goat browses, has in many instances been reduced
to a few miserable patches. Torrents of rain have carried away the mould, and
the naked rock appears on the surface. From a distance we only see greyish
declivities, dotted here and there with a few wretched shrubs. Even in the days
of Strabo most mountains along the coasts had been robbed of their forests, and one
of our modern authors says that “Greece is a skeleton only of what it used to be&#x202f;!”
By a sort of irony, geographical names derived from trees abound throughout
Hellas and Turkey: Caryæ is the “town of walnut-trees,” Valanidia that of the
Valonia oaks, Kyparissi that of cypresses, Platanos or Plataniki that of plane-trees.
Everywhere we meet with localities whose appellation is justified by
nothing. Forests at the present day are confined almost entirely to the interior
and to the Ionian coast. The Œta Mountains, some of the mountains of Ætolia,
the hills of Acarnania, and Arcadia, Elis, Triphylia, and the slopes of the Taygetus,
in the Peloponnesus, still retain their forests. And it is only in these forest
districts, visited solely by herdsmen, that savage animals, such as the wolf, the fox,
and the jackal, are now met with. The chamois, it is said, still haunts the recesses
of the Pindus and Œta Mountains; but the wild boar of the Erymanthus, which
must have been a distinct species if we are to judge by antique sculptures, exists
no more in Greece, and the lion, still mentioned by Aristotle, has not been seen
for two thousand years. Amongst the smaller animals there is a turtle, common
in some parts of the Peloponnesus, which the natives look upon with the same
aversion as do many western nations upon the toad and the salamander.</p>

<p>Greece is a small country, but the variety of its climate is nevertheless great.
Striking differences in the climate of different localities are produced by the
contrasts between mountains and plains, woodlands and sterile valleys, coasts
having a northern or southern aspect. But even leaving out of sight these
local differences, it may safely be asserted that the varieties of climate which we
meet with in traversing Greece from north to south are scarcely exceeded in any
other region. The mountains of Ætolia, in the north, whose slopes are covered
with beech-trees, remind us of the temperate zone of Europe, whilst the peninsulas
and islands towards the east and south, with their thickets of fig and olive trees,
their plantations of oranges and lemons, their aloe hedges and rare palm-trees,
belong to the sub-tropical zone. But even
neighbouring districts occasionally <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
differ strikingly as regards climate. In the ancient lake basin of Bœotia the winters
are cold, the summers scorching, whilst the temperature of the eastern shore of
Eubœa is equable, owing to the moderating influence of sea breezes. Within a
narrow compass Greece presents us with the climates of a large portion of the
earth, and there can be no doubt that this diversity of climate, and the contrasts of
every kind springing from it, must have favourably influenced the intellectual
development of the Hellenes. A spirit of inquiry was called forth amongst them
which reacted upon their commercial tastes and industrial proclivities.</p>

<p>The diversity of the climate of the land, however, is compensated for, in
Greece, by a uniformity in the climate of the maritime districts. As in a mountain
valley, the winds of the Ægean Sea blow alternately in contrary directions.
During nearly the whole of summer the atmospheric currents of Eastern Europe are
attracted towards the African deserts. The winds from the north of the Archipelago
and Macedonia then speed the navigator on his voyage to the south, and on
many occasions the conquering tribes of the northern shores of that sea have
availed themselves of them in their improvised attacks upon the inhabitants of the
more southern districts of Asia Minor and of Greece. These regular northerly
currents, known as etesian or annual winds, cease on the termination of the
hot season, when the sun stands above the southern tropic. They are, moreover,
interrupted every night, when the cool sea air is attracted by the heated surface of
the land. When the sun has set the wind gradually subsides; there is a calm,
lasting a few moments; and then the air begins to move in an inverse direction—“the
land begins to blow,” as the sailors say. Nor is this regular wind without
its counter-current, known as the <i>embates</i>, or propitious south-easterly breeze of
which the poets sing. General winds and breezes, moreover, are deflected from
their original directions in consequence of the configuration of the coast and the
direction of mountain chains. The Gulf of Corinth, for instance, is shut in by
high mountains on the north and the south, and the winds alternately enter it
from the east or west—a phenomenon likened by Strabo to the breathing of an
animal.</p>

<p>The rains, like the winds, deviate in many places from the average, and whilst
the water pours down into some mountain valleys as into a funnel, elsewhere the
clouds drift past without parting with a drop of their humid burden. Contrasts
in the amount of precipitation are thus added to those resulting from differences
of configuration and variety of climate. As a rule, rain is more abundant on the
western shores of Greece than on the eastern, and this fact accounts for the smiling
aspect of the hills of Elis, as compared with the barren declivities of Argolis and
Attica. Thunder-storms, driven before the winds of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, likewise
recur with greater regularity in the western portion of the peninsula. In Elis and
Acarnania the roll of thunder may be heard in spring daily, for whole weeks, in
the afternoon. No sites more apposite could have been found for temples dedicated
to Jupiter, the god of lightning.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The ancient inhabitants of the Cyclades, and probably, also, those
of the coasts <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
of Hellas and Asia Minor, had already attained a considerable amount of culture
long before the commencement of our historical records. This has been proved by
excavations made in the volcanic ashes of Santorin and Therasia. At the time
their houses were buried beneath the ashes, the Santoriniotes had begun to pass
from the age of stone into that of copper. They knew how to build arches of
stone and mortar, they manufactured lime, used weights made of blocks of lava,
wove cloth, made pottery, dyed their stuffs, and ornamented their houses with
frescoes; they cultivated barley, peas, and lentils, and had begun to trade with
distant countries.</p>

<p>We do not know whether these men were of the same race as the Hellenes;
but thus much is certain—that at the earliest dawn of history the islands and
coasts of the Ægean Sea were peopled by various families of Greeks, whilst the
interior of the country and the western shores of the peninsula were inhabited by
Pelasgians. These Pelasgians, moreover, were of the same stock as the Greeks,
and they spoke a language derived from the same source as the dialects of the
Hellenes. Both were Aryans, and, unless natives of the soil, they must have
immigrated into Greece from Asia Minor by crossing the Hellespont, or by way of
the islands of the Archipelago. The Pelasgians, according to tradition, sprang
from Mount Lycæus, in the centre of the Peloponnesus; they boasted of being
“autochthons,” “men of the black soil,” “children of oaks,” or “men born before
the moon.” All around them lived tribes of kindred origin, such as the Æolians
and the Leleges, and these were afterwards joined by Ionians and Achæans.
The Ionians, who, in a subsequent age, exercised so great an influence over the
destinies of the world, only occupied the peninsula of Attica and the neighbouring
Eubœa. The Achæans for a long time enjoyed a preponderance, and in the end
the Greek clans collectively became known by that name. Later on, when the
Dorians had crossed the Gulf of Corinth where it is narrowest, and established
themselves as conquerors in the Peloponnesus, the Amphictyons, or national
councils, sitting alternately at Thermopylæ and Delphi, conferred the name of
Hellenes, which was that of a small tribe in Thessaly and Phthiotis, upon all
the inhabitants of the peninsula and the islands. The name of Greek, which
signifies, perhaps, “mountaineer,” “ancient,” or “son of the soil,” gradually
spread amongst the nation, and in the end became general. The Ionians of Asia
Minor, and the Carians of the Sporades, emulated the Phœnicians by trading from
port to port amongst these half-savage tribes, and, like bees which convey the
fecundating pollen from flower to flower, they carried the civilisation of Egypt and
the East from tribe to tribe.</p>

<p>Phœnician merchants and Roman conquerors scarcely modified the elements
composing the population of Hellas, but during the age of migrations barbarians
in large numbers penetrated into Greece. For more than two centuries did the
Avares maintain themselves in the Peloponnesus. Then came the Slavs, aided, on
more than one occasion, by the plague in depopulating the country. Greece became
a Slavonia, and a Slavonian language, probably Servian, was universally spoken,
as is proved by the majority of geographical names. The
superstitions and legends <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
of the modern Greeks, as has been remarked by many authors, are not simply a
heritage derived from the ancient Hellenes, but have become enriched by phantoms
and vampires of Slav invention. The dress of the Greeks, too, is a legacy of their
northern conquerors. But, in spite of this, the polished language
of the Hellenes <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
has regained by degrees its ancient preponderance, and the race has so thoroughly
amalgamated these foreign immigrants, that it is impossible now to trace any
Servian elements in the population. But hardly had Hellas escaped the danger of
becoming Slav when it was threatened with becoming Albanian. This occurred
during the dominion of Venice. As recently as the commencement of the present
century Albanian was the dominant language of Elis, Argos, Bœotia, and Attica,
and even at the present day a hundred thousand supposed Hellenes still speak
it. The actual population of Greece is, therefore, a very mixed one, but it is
difficult to say in what proportions these Hellenic, Slav, and Albanian elements
have combined. The Mainotes, or Maniotes, of the peninsula terminating in
Cape Matapan, are generally supposed to be the Greeks of the purest blood.
They themselves claim to be the descendants of the ancient Spartans, and amongst
their strongholds they still point out one which belonged to “Signor Lycurgus.”
Their Councils of Elders have preserved from immemorial times, and down to
the war of independence, the title of Senate of Lacedæmonia. Every Mainote
professes to love unto death “Liberty, the highest of all goods, inherited from
our Spartan ancestors.” Nevertheless, a good many localities in Maina bear
names derived from the Servian, and these prove, at all events, that the Slavs
resided in the country for a considerable time. The Mainotes practise the
<i>vendetta</i>, as if they were Montenegrins. But is not this a common custom
amongst all uncivilised nations?</p>

<p>However this may be, in spite of invasions and intermixture with other
races, the Greeks of to-day agree in most points with the Greeks of the past.
Above all things, they have preserved their language, and it is truly matter
for surprise that the vulgar Greek, though derived from a rural dialect, should
differ so slightly only from the literary language. The differences, analogous
to what may be observed with respect to the languages derived from the Latin,
are restricted almost to two points, viz. the contraction of non-accentuated
syllables and the use of auxiliary verbs. It was, therefore, easy for the modern
Greeks to purify their language from barbarisms and foreign terms, and to
restore it gradually to what it was in the time of Thucydides. Nor has the
race changed much in its physical features, for in most districts of modern
Greece the ancient types may yet be recognised. The Bœotian is still distinguished
by that heavy gait which made him an object of ridicule amongst
the other Greeks; the Athenian youth possesses the suppleness, grace of movement
and bearing which we admire so much in the horsemen sculptured on
the friezes of the Parthenon; the Spartan women have preserved that haughty
and vigorous beauty which constituted the charm of the virgins of Doris. As
regards morals, the descent of the modern Hellenes is equally evident. Like
their ancestors, they are fond of change, and inquisitive; as the descendants
of free citizens, they have preserved a feeling of equality; and, still infatuated
with dialectics, they hold forth at all times as if they were in the ancient
market-place, or Agora. They frequently stoop to flattery: like the ancient
Greeks, too, they are apt to rate intellectual merit above
purity of morals. <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
Like sage Ulysses of the Homeric poem, they well know how to lie and cheat
with grace; and the truthful Acarnanian and the Mainote, who are “slow to
promise, but sure to keep,” are looked upon as rural oddities. Another
trait in the character of the modern and ancient Greeks, and one which
distinguishes them from all other Europeans, is this—that they do not allow
themselves to be carried away by passion, except in the cause of patriotism.
The Greek is a stranger to melancholy: he loves life, and is determined to enjoy
it. In battle he may throw it away, but suicide is a species of death
unknown amongst the modern Greeks, and the more unhappy they are, the
more they cling to existence. They are very seldom afflicted with insanity.</p>

<p>In spite of the diverse elements which compose it, the Greek nationality is
one of the most homogeneous in Europe. The Albanians, of Pelasgian descent
like the Greeks, do not cede to the latter in patriotism; and it was they—the
Suliotes, Hydriotes, Spezziotes—who fought most valiantly for national independence.
The eight hundred families of Rumanian or Kutzo-Wallachian Zinzares
who pasture their herds in the hills of Acarnania and Ætolia, and are known as
Kara-Gunis, or “black cloaks,” speak the two languages, and sometimes marry
Greek girls, though they never give their own daughters in marriage to the
Greeks. Haughty and free, they are not sufficiently numerous to be of any great
importance. To foreigners the Greeks are rather intolerant, and they take no
pains to render their stay amongst them agreeable. The Turks—who were
numerous formerly in certain parts of the Peloponnesus, in Bœotia,
and in the <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
island of Eubœa, and whose presence recalled an unhappy period of servitude—have
fled to a man, and only the fez, the narghile, and the slippers remind us of
their former presence. The Jews, though met with in every town of the East,
whether Slav or Mussulman, dare hardly enter the presence of the Greeks, who
are, moreover, their most redoubtable rivals in matters of finance: they are to be
found only in the Ionian Islands, where they managed to get a footing during
the British Protectorate. In this same Archipelago we likewise meet with the
descendants of the ancient Venetian colonists, and with emigrants from all parts
of Italy. French and Italian families still form a distinct element of the population
of Naxos, Santorin, and Syra. As to the Maltese porters and gardeners
at Athens and Corfu, they continue for the most part in subordinate positions,
and never associate with the Greeks.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The homogeneous character of the population of Greece does not admit of
that country being divided into ethnological provinces, like Turkey or Austro-Hungary,
but it consists geographically of four distinct portions. These are
(1), continental Hellas, known since the Turkish invasion as Rumelia, in
remembrance of the “Roman” empire of Byzantium; (2), the ancient Peloponnesus,
now called the Morea, perhaps a transposition of the word “Romea,” or
from a Slav word signifying “sea coast,” and applied formerly to Elis;
(3), the islands of the Ægean Sea; (4), the Ionian Islands. In describing the
various portions of Greece we shall make use, in preference, of the ancient names
of mountains, rivers, and towns; for the Hellenes of our own day, proud of the
glories of the past, are endeavouring gradually to get rid of names of Slav or
Italian origin, which still figure upon the maps of their country.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn13" id="fnanch13">13</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">The
Pindus, which forms the central chain of Southern Turkey, passes over
into Greece, and imparts to it an analogous orographical character. On both
sides of this conventional boundary we meet with the same rocks, the same
vegetation, the same landscape features, and the same races of people. By
dividing the Epirus and handing over Thessaly to the Turks, European diplomacy
has paid no attention to natural features. The eastern portion of the boundary
is made to follow the line of water parting over the range of the lofty Othrys,
commanding the plain of the Sperchius. Westward of the
Pindus the boundary <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
crosses transversely the valley of the Achelous, and the hills which separate it
from the Gulf of Arta.</p>

<p>The isolated summit of Mount Tymphrestus, or Velukhi, which rises where
the grand chain of the Othrys branches off from the Pindus, is not the culminating
point of continental Greece, but it is a centre from which the principal
mountain spurs and rivers radiate. Within its spurs lies hidden the charming
valley of Karpenisi, and an elevated ridge joins them, towards the south-east,
to the most important mountain mass of modern Greece, viz. the group surmounted
by the snow-clad pyramids of the Vardusia and Khiona, whose slopes
are covered with dark firs, and to the superb Katavothra, the Œta of the
ancients, on which Hercules built his funeral pile. The mountains of Vardusia
and Khiona are face to face with the fine mountain masses of Northern Morea,
likewise wooded and covered with snow during the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>The mountains of Ætolia, to the west of the Velukhi and the Vardusia, are
far less elevated, but they are rugged, and form a veritable chaos of rocks,
savage defiles, and thickets, into which only Wallachian herdsmen venture. In
Southern Ætolia, on the shores of the lakes and along the rivers, the country is
more accessible, but mountains rise there likewise, and by tortuous ridges they
are brought into connection with the system of the Pindus. Those on the coast
of Acarnania, opposite to the Ionian Islands, are steep, covered with trees and
shrubs; they are the mountains of the “Black Continent”
mentioned by Ulysses. <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
To the east of the Achelous there is another coast chain, well known to mariners:
this is the Zygos, the southern slopes of which, arid and austere, are seen from
off Missolonghi. Still further to the east another range comes down to the
seashore, and, together with the promontories on the opposite coast of the Morea,
forms the narrow entrance to the Gulf of Corinth. Close to this entrance, on
the Ætolian side, there rises bold Mount Varassova, a huge block of rock. Local
tradition tells us that the Titans endeavoured to throw this rock into the sea, so
that it might form a bridge between the two coasts; but the rock proved too
heavy, and it was dropped where we now see it.</p>

<p>Towards the Ægean Sea the mountain mass of the Katavothra is continued
by a coast range running in a direction parallel to the mountains of the island of
Eubœa. This range should be described rather as a series of mountain-groups
separated from each other by deep hollows, extensive depressions, and even by
river valleys. These mountains, though low and intersected by numerous roads,
are nevertheless difficult of access, for their slopes are steep, their promontories
abrupt, and their precipices sudden, and in the times of the ancient Greeks a
small number of men repeatedly defended them against large armies. At one
extremity of this range is the passage of Thermopylæ; at the other, on the
eastern foot of the Pentelicus, the famous plain of Marathon.</p>

<p>The mountain groups on the northern shore of the Gulf of Corinth, and to
the south of Bœotia, may be looked upon as a range running parallel with that
following the channel of Eubœa, but far more beautiful and picturesque. Every
one of its summits recalls the sweet memories of poetry, or conjures up the
image of some ancient deity. To the west we find ourselves in the presence
of “double-headed” Parnassus, to which fled Deucalion and Pyrrha, the
ancestors of the Greeks, and where the Athenians celebrated their torchlight
dances in honour of Bacchus. From the summits of the Parnassus, which rival
in height those of the Khiona, raising its pyramidal head towards the north-west,
nearly the whole of Greece, with its gulfs, islands, and mountains, lies spread out
below us, from the Thessalian Olympus to the Taygetus, at the extremity of the
Peloponnesus; and close by, at our feet, lies the admirable basin of Delphi, the
place of Peace and Concord, where Greeks forgot their animosities. The
mountain group towards the east next to Parnassus is quite equal to it. The
valleys of the Helicon, the seat of Apollo and the Muses, are still the most
verdant and the most smiling in all Greece. The eastern slope of the Helicon is
more especially distinguished for its charming beauty, its woods, its verdant
pastures, gardens, and murmuring springs, which contrast most favourably with the
bare and arid plains of Bœotia. If Mount Parnassus may boast of the Castalian
spring, Mount Helicon possesses that of Hippocrene, which burst forth from the
ground when struck by the hoof of Pegasus. The elongated summit of the
Cithæron, the birthplace of Bacchus, joins the mountains of Southern Bœotia
to those of Attica, whose marble has become famous through the neighbourhood
of the city which they shelter. Mount Parnes rises to the north of Athens;
to the east of it, like the pediment of a temple, rises the Pentelicus,
in which are <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
the quarries of Pikermi, rendered famous through their fossil bones; on the
south appears Mount Hymettus, celebrated for its flowers and its bees. Farther
away, the Laurium, with its rich argentiferous slags, stretches towards the south-east,
and terminates in Cape Sunium, consecrated in other days to Minerva
and Neptune, and still surmounted by fifteen columns of an ancient temple.</p>

<p>Another isolated mountain group to the south of Attica, and occupying the
entire width of the Isthmus of Megara, served the Athenians as a rampart of
defence against their neighbours of the Peloponnesus. This is the mountain
group of Gerania, the modern Pera Khora.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn14" id="fnanch14">14</a> Having passed beyond it, we find
ourselves upon the Isthmus of Corinth, properly so called, confined between the
Gulfs of Athens and of Corinth. It is a narrow neck of land, scarcely five miles
across, whose arid limestone rocks hardly rise two hundred feet above the sea. This
neutral bit of territory, lying between two distinct geographical regions, naturally
became a place for meetings, festivals, and markets. The remains of a wall
built by the Peloponnesians across the isthmus may still be traced, as may also
the canal commenced by order of Nero.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The limestone mountains of Greece, as well as those of the Epirus and of
Thessaly, abound in lakes, but all the rivers are swallowed up in “sinks,” or
<i>katavothras</i>, leaving the land dry and arid. Southern Acarnania, a portion of which
is known as Xeromeros, or the “arid country,” on account of the absence of running
water, abounds in lake basins of this kind. To the south of the Gulf of
Arta, which may not inaptly be described as a sort of lake communicating with the
sea through a narrow opening, there are several sheets of water, the remains of an
inland sea, silted up by the alluvial deposits of the Achelous. The largest of these
lakes is known to the natives as Pelagos, or “big sea,” because of its extent and
the agitated state of its waters, which break against its coasts. This is the
Trichonius of the ancient Ætolians. Reputed unfathomable, it is, in truth, very
deep, and its waters are perfectly pure; but they are discharged sluggishly into
another basin far less extensive, and surrounded by pestilential marshes, and
through a turgid stream they even find their way into the Achelous. The hills
surrounding Lake Trichonis are covered with villages and fields, whilst the locality
around the lower lake has been depopulated by fever. The country, nevertheless,
is exceedingly beautiful to look upon. Hardly have we passed through a narrow
gorge, or <i>klisura</i>, of Mount Zygos before we enter upon a bridge over a mile
in length, which a Turkish governor caused to be thrown across the swamps
separating the two lakes. This viaduct has sunk
down more than half its <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
height into the mud, but it is still sufficiently elevated to enable the eye freely
to sweep over the surface of the waters, and to trace the coasts which bound them.
Oaks, planes, and wild olive-trees intermingle beneath us, their branches hung
with festoons of wild vine, and these, with the blue waters of the lake and
the mountains rising beyond it, form a picture of great beauty.</p>

<p>Another lake basin lies to the south of the Zygos, between the alluvial
lands of the Achelous and the Fidari. It is occupied by a swamp filled with fresh,
brackish, or salt water; and since the days of ancient Greece, this swamp,
owing to the apathy of the inhabitants, has continued to increase in extent at
the expense of the cultivated land. Missolonghi the heroic is indebted for its
name to its position near these marshes, for the meaning of it is “centre of
marshes.” A barrier, or <i>ramma</i>, here and there broken through by the floods,
separates the basin of Missolonghi from the Ionian Sea. During the war of independence
every opening in this barrier was protected by redoubts or stockades,
but at present the only obstruction consists of the reed barriers of the fishermen,
which are opened in spring to admit the fish from the sea, and closed in summer
to prevent their escape. Missolonghi, though surrounded by brackish water, is a
healthy place, thanks to the breezes from the sea; whilst a heavy atmosphere
charged with miasmata hangs perpetually over the bustling little town of
Ætoliko (Anatolikon), which lies farther to the north-west in the midst of the
swamps, and is joined to the dry land by two bridges. Between Ætoliko and
the river Achelous may be observed a large number of rocky eminences, rising
like pyramids above the plain. These are no doubt ancient islands, such as
still exist between the mainland and the island of St. Mauro. The mud brought
down by the Achelous has gradually converted the
intervals between these <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
rocks into dry land. In former times the commercial city of Œniadæ occupied
one of these islets. The geological changes already noticed by Herodotus are
thus still going on under our eyes, and the muds of the Achelous, to which it
owes its modern name of Aspro, or “white,” incessantly extend the land at the
expense of the sea.</p>

<p>The Achelous, which the ancients likened to a savage bull, owing to its
rapid current and great volume, is by far the most important river of Greece.
One of the great feats ascribed to Hercules consisted in breaking off one of
the horns of this bull; that is to say, he embanked the river, and thus protected
the lands which it used to inundate. The neighbours of the Achelous, the
rapid Fidari (Evenus, on the banks of which Hercules killed the centaur
Nessus, for offering violence to Dejanira) and the Mornos, which rises in the
snows of the Œta, cannot compare with it. Still less is it equalled by the
Oropus, the Cephissus, and the Ilissus, “wet only when it rains,” which flow
eastward into the Ægean Sea. The principal river of Eastern Greece, the
Sperchius, is inferior to the Achelous, but, like it, has extensively changed the
aspect of the plain near its mouth. When Leonidas and his three hundred heroes
guarded the defiles of Thermopylæ against the Persians, the Gulf of Lamia
extended much farther into the land than it does now. But the alluvial deposits
of the river have extended its delta, and several rivulets
which formerly flowed <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
directly into the sea have now to be numbered amongst its tributaries; the sea has
retired from the foot of the Callidromus for a distance of several miles; and the
narrow pass of Thermopylæ has been converted into a plain sufficiently wide
to enable an entire army to manœuvre upon it. The hot springs which gush
from the rocks, by forming deposits of calcareous tufa, may likewise have contributed
towards this change of coast-line; nor are more violent convulsions of
nature precluded in a volcanic region like this, subject to frequent earthquakes.
Sailors still point out a small island in this neighbourhood, formed of scoriæ,
from which the incensed Hercules hurled his companion, Lichas, into the ocean.
Hot springs abound on the opposite coast of Eubœa, and the incrustations
formed by them are so considerable as to assume the appearance of glaciers
when seen from a distance. A bathing establishment exists now near the hot
sulphur springs of Thermopylæ, and strangers are thus enabled to explore this
region, so rich in memories of a great past. The pedestal, however, upon
which reposed the figure of a marble lion, placed there in honour of Leonidas,
has been destroyed by ruthless hands, and utilised in the construction of a
mill&#x202f;!</p>

<p>The basin of the Cephissus, enclosed by the chains of the Œta and Parnassus,
is one of the most remarkable from an hydrological point of view. The river
first flows through a bottom-land formerly a lake, and then, forcing for itself a
passage through a narrow defile commanded by the spurs of Mount Parnassus,
it winds round the rock upon which stood the ancient city of Orchomenus, and
enters upon a vast plain, where swamps and lakes are embedded amidst cultivated
fields and reed-banks. These swamps are fed, likewise, by numerous
torrents descending from the Helicon and other mountains in its vicinity.
One of these is the torrent of Livadia, into which the bounteous springs
of Memory and Oblivion—Mnemosyne and Lethe—discharge themselves. In
summer a large portion of the plain is dry, and it yields a bountiful harvest
of maize, the stalks of which are sweet like sugar-cane. But after the heavy
rains of autumn and winter the waters rise twenty, and even twenty-five feet,
and the plain is converted into a vast lake, ninety-six square miles in extent. The
myth of the deluge of Ogyges almost leads us to believe that the rising floods
occasionally invaded every valley which debouches into this basin. To the
ancients the shallower part of this lake was known as Cephissus, and its deep
eastern portion as Copais, from Copæ, a town occupying a promontory on its
northern shore, and now called Topolias.</p>

<p>The importance of regulating the floods just referred to, and of preventing
the sudden overflow of the waters to the destruction of the cultivated fields,
may readily be imagined. The ancient Greeks made an effort to accomplish this
task. To the east of the large Lake of Copais there is another lake basin, about
one hundred and thirty feet lower, and encompassed by precipitous rocks, incapable
of cultivation. This basin, the Hylice of the Bœotians, appears to be made by
nature for receiving the superabundant waters of the Copais. The remains of a
canal may still be traced in the plain, which was evidently intended
to convey into <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
it the floods of the Copais, but it appears never to have been completed. No
doubt care was taken to keep open the various <i>katavothras</i>, or subterranean
channels, through which the waters of the Copaic lake discharge themselves into
the sea. One of these, on the north-western shore of the lake, and close to
the rock of Orchomenus, swallowed up the river Melas, and conveyed its waters
to the Gulf of Atalanta. Farther to the east other subterranean channels flow
towards Lakes Hylice and Paralimni, but the most important of these channels
are towards the north-east, in the Gulf of Kokkino. In that extreme angle of
the lake, the veritable Copais, the waters of the Cephissus rush against the foot
of Mount Skroponeri, and are swallowed up by the ground so as to form a subterranean
delta. To the south there is a cavernous opening in the rock, but
this is merely a sort of tunnel passing underneath a promontory, and, except
during the rainy season, it may be traversed dry-shod. Beyond this, another
opening swallows up one of the most important branches of the Cephissus,
which makes its reappearance in the shape of bounteous springs pouring their
waters into the sea. Two other branches of the river disappear in the rocks
about a mile farther north. They join soon afterwards, and flow northwards
beneath the bottom of a sinuous valley. The old Greek engineers dug pits in this
valley, which enabled them to descend to the subterranean waters, and to clear away
obstructions interfering with their flow. Sixteen of these pits have been discovered
between the opening of the katavothra and the place where the waters reappear.
Some of these are still thirty to one hundred feet in depth; but most of them have
become choked up with stones and earth. These ancient engineering works, which
Crates vainly endeavoured to restore in the time of
Alexander, may possibly date <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
from the mythical age of King Minyas of Orchomenus,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn15" id="fnanch15">15</a> and the successful draining
of these marshes may account for the well-filled treasury of that king spoken
of by Homer. Thus the ingenuity of the Homeric age had succeeded in accomplishing
a work of the engineering art which baffles our modern men of science&#x202f;!</p>

 PEASANTS FROM THE ENVIRONS OF ATHENS.</div>
</div><!--dctr-->

<hr class="hr40" />

<p>The whole of Western Greece, filled as it is by the mountains of Acarnania,
Ætolia, and Phocis, is condemned by nature to play a very subordinate part to
the eastern provinces. In the time of the ancient Greeks these provinces were
looked upon almost as a portion of the world of the barbarians, and even in our
own days the Ætolians are the least cultivated of all the Greeks. There is no
commerce except at a few privileged places close to the sea, such as Missolonghi,
Ætoliko, Salona, and Galaxidi. The latter, which is situated on a bay, into
which flows the Pleistus, a river at one time consecrated to Neptune, although
quite dry during the greater part of the year, was, up to the war of independence,
the busiest seaport on the Gulf of Corinth. As for Naupactus, or Epakto,
(called Lepanto by the Italians), it was important merely from a strategical point
of view, on account of its position at the entrance of the Gulf of Corinth, which
is sometimes named after it. Many naval engagements were fought to force the
entrance into the gulf, defended by the castles of Rumelia and Morea—the ancient
Rhium and Antirrhium. A curious phenomenon has been observed in connection
with the channel which forms the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth. Nowhere
more than 36 fathoms in depth, it is subject to perpetual changes in its width,
owing to the formation of alluvial deposits by maritime currents. What one
current deposits is carried away by the other. At the epoch of the Peloponnesian
war this channel was 7 stadia, or about 1,200 yards, wide; at the time of
Strabo its width was only 5 stadia; whilst in our own days it is no less than
2,200 yards from promontory to promontory. The entrance of the Gulf of Arta,
between the Turkish Epirus and Greek Acarnania, does not present the same
phenomena, and its present width is about equal to that assigned to it by every
ancient author; that is to say, about 1,000 yards.</p>

<p>The valleys and lake basins of Eastern Greece, and more especially its position
between the Gulf of Corinth, the Ægean Sea, and the channel of Eubœa, which
almost convert it into a peninsula, sufficiently account for the prosperity of that
country. With its cities of Thebes, Athens, and Megara, it is essentially a
land of historical reminiscences. The contrast between the two most important
districts of this region—Bœotia and Attica—is very striking. The first of these
is an inland basin, the waters of which are collected into lakes, where mists
accumulate, and a rich vegetation springs forth from a fat alluvial soil. Attica,
on the other hand, is arid. A thin layer of mould covers the terraces of its rocky
slopes; its valleys open out into the sea; the summits of its mountains rise into
an azure sky; and the blue waters of the Ægean wash their base. Had the
Greeks been fearful of the sea; had they confined themselves,
as in the earliest <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
ages, to the cultivation of the soil, Bœotia, no doubt, would have retained the
preponderance which it enjoyed in the time of the Minyæ of wealthy Orchomenus.
But the progress of navigation and the allurements of commerce, which proved
irresistible to the Greeks, were bound by degrees to transfer the lead to the
men of Attica. The city of Athens, which arose in the midst of the largest
plain of this peninsula, therefore occupied a position which assured to it a grand
future.</p>

<p>The choice of Athens as the modern capital of Greece has been much
criticized. Times have changed, no doubt, and the natural centres of commerce
have become shifted, in consequence of the migrations of nations. Corinth, on
the isthmus joining continental Greece to the Peloponnesus, and commanding two
seas, undoubtedly deserved the preference. Its facilities for communicating with
Constantinople and the Greek maritime districts still under the rule of the
Osmanli, on the one hand, and with the western world, from which now proceed
all civilising impulses, on the other, are certainly greater than those of Athens.
If Greece, instead of a small centralised kingdom, had become a federal republic,
which would have been more in accordance with her genius and traditions, there
is no doubt that other towns of Greece, more favourably situated than Athens
for establishing rapid communications with the rest of Europe, would soon have
surpassed that town in population and commercial wealth. Athens, however,
has grown upon its plain, and, by the construction of a railway, it
has become even <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
a maritime city, as in ancient days, when its triple walls joined it to the ports of
the Piræus and Phalerum.</p>

<p>But how great the difference between the monuments of the ancient city and
of the modern&#x202f;! The Parthenon, though gutted by the shells of the Venetian
Morosini, and robbed since of its finest sculptures, still retains its pure and simple
beauty, which agrees so well with the sobriety of the surrounding landscape—still
remains the finest architectural work of the world. By the side of this
majestic ruin, on the same plateau of the Acropolis, where the mariner in the
Gulf of Ægina saw the gilt spear-head of Athene Promachos glitter in the sun,
there rise other monuments, the Erechtheum and the Propylæa, hardly inferior
to it, and dating likewise from the great period of art. Outside the city, on a
promontory, rises the temple of Theseus, the best-preserved monument of Greek
antiquity. Elsewhere, on the banks of the Ilissus, a group of columns
marks the site of the magnificent temple of Olympian Jupiter, which it took the
Athenians seven hundred years to build, and which their degenerate descendants
made use of as a quarry. Remarkable remains have been discovered in many
other parts of the ancient city, and the least of them are of interest, for they
recall the memory of illustrious men. On such a rock sat the Areopagus which
condemned Socrates; from this stone tribune Demosthenes addressed the multitude;
and here walked Plato with his disciples&#x202f;!</p>

<p>A similar historical interest attaches to nearly every part of Attica, whether
we visit the city of Eleusis, where the mysteries of Ceres were
celebrated, or the <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
city of Megara, with its double Acropolis, or whether we explore the field of
Marathon and the shores of the island of Salamis. Even beyond Attica the
memories of the past attract the traveller to Platæa, to Leuctra, Chæronea, Thebes
of Œdipus, and Orchomenus of Minyas, though, in comparison with what these
districts were in other times, they are now deserts. In addition to Athens and
Thebes, there are now only two cities in eastern continental Greece which are of
any importance. These are Lamia, in the midst of the low plains of the
Sperchius, and Livadia, in Bœotia, at one time celebrated for the cavern of
Trophonius, which archæologists have not yet succeeded in identifying. The
island of Ægina, which belongs to Attica, offers the same spectacle of decay and
depopulation as the mainland. Anciently it supported more than two hundred
thousand inhabitants; at present it hardly numbers six thousand. But the island
still retains the picturesque ruin of its temple of Minerva, and the prospect which
it affords of the amphitheatre of hills in Argolis and Attica is as magnificent
as ever.</p>

 <span class="smcap">P<b>ELOPONNESUS.</b></span></h3></div>

<p class="pfirst">Geographically
the Peloponnesus well deserves the name of island, which was
bestowed upon it by the ancients. The low Isthmus of Corinth completely severs
it from the mountainous peninsula of Greece. It is a world in itself, small
enough as far as the mere space is concerned which it occupies upon the map,
but great on account of the part it has played in the
history of humanity. <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span></p>

<p>On entering the Peloponnesus from the Isthmus of Corinth, we see rising in
front of us the mountain rampart of Oneium, which defended the entrance of the
peninsula, and upon one of whose promontories was built the nearly impregnable
citadel of Corinth. These mountains form part of the general mountain system of
the whole island, and, sheltered by them, its inhabitants could live in security.
The principal mountain mass, whence all other chains radiate towards the
entrances of the peninsula, is situated in the interior of the country, about
forty miles to the west of Corinth. There Mount Cyllene of the ancient Greeks,
or Zyria, rises into the air, its flanks covered with dark pines; and farther away
still, the Khelmos, or Aroanian Mountain, attains even a more considerable
height, its snows descending into a valley on its northern slope, where they give
rise to the river Styx, the cold waters of which prove fatal to perjurers, and disappear
in a narrow chasm, one of the entrances to Hades. A range of wooded
peaks, to the west of the Khelmos, connects that mountain with the Olonos (Mount
Erymanthus), celebrated as the haunt of the savage boar destroyed by Hercules.
All those mountains, from Corinth as far as Patras, form a rampart running
parallel with the southern shore of the gulf, in the direction of which they throw
off spurs enclosing steep valleys. In one of these—that of Buraikos—we meet
with the grand caverns of Mega-Spileon, which are used as a monastery, and
where the most curious structures may be seen built up on every vantage-ground
offered by the rocks, suggesting a resemblance to the cells of a vast nest of
hornets.</p>

<p>The table-land of the Peloponnesus is thus bounded towards the north by an
elevated coast range. Another chain of the same kind bounds it on the east.
It likewise starts from Mount Cyllene, and extends southward, its various portions
being known as Gaurias, Malevo (Mount Artemisium), and Parthenion. It is then
broken through by a vast depression, but again rises farther south as the range
of Hagios Petros, or Parnon, to the east of Sparta. Getting lower by degrees, it
terminates in the promontory of Malea, opposite to the island of Cerigo. It was
this cape, tradition tells us, which formed the last refuge of the Centaurs; that
is to say, of the barbarian ancestors of the modern Tsakonians. No promontory
was more dreaded by Greek navigators than this Cape Malea, owing to sudden
gusts of wind, and an ancient proverb says, “When thou hast doubled the cape
forget the name of thy native land.”</p>

<p>The mountains of Western Morea do not present the regularity of the eastern
chain. They are cut through by rivers, and to the south of the Aroanian Mountains
and the Erymanthus they ramify into a multitude of minor chains, which
now and then combine into mountain groups, and impart the most varied aspect
to that portion of the plateau. Everywhere in the valleys we come unexpectedly
upon landscapes to which an indescribable charm is imparted by a group of trees,
a spring, a flock of sheep, or a shepherd sitting upon a heap of ruins. We are in
beautiful Arcadia, sung by the poets. Though in great part deprived of its woods,
it is still a beautiful country; but more charming still are the eastern slopes of the
plateau, which descend towards the Ionian Sea. There
luxuriant forests and <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
sparkling rivulets add an element of beauty to blue waves, distant islands, and a
transparent sky, which is wanting in nearly every other part of maritime Greece.</p>

</div><!--dctr--></div>

<p>The table-land of Arcadia is commanded on the west by pine-clad Mænalus,
and bounded on the south by several mountain groups which give birth to
separate mountain chains. One of these mountain masses—the Kotylion, or
Palæocastro—thus gives rise to the mountains of Messenia, amongst which rises the
famous Ithome, and to those of Ægaleus, which spread over the peninsula to the
west of the Gulf of Coron, and reappear in the sea as the rocky islets of Sapienza,
Cabrera, and Venetikon. Another mountain mass, the Lycæus, or Diaforti—the
Arcadian Olympus, which the Pelasgians claim for their cradle—and which rises
almost in the centre of the Peloponnesus, is continued westward of Laconia by an
extended mountain chain, the most elevated and most characteristic of all the
Morea. The highest crest of these mountains is the famous Taygetus, known also
as Pentedactylum (five fingers), because of the five peaks which surmount it; or
as St. Elias, in honour, no doubt, of Helios, the Dorian sun-god. A portion of
the lower slopes of this mountain is clothed with forests of
chestnuts and walnuts. <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
interspersed with cypresses and oaks; but its crest is bare, and snow remains
upon it during three-fourths of the year. The snows of Taygetus direct the
distant mariner to the shores of Greece. On approaching the coast, he sees rising
above the blue waters the spurs and outlying ridges of the Kakavuni, or “bad
mountain.” Soon afterwards he comes in sight of the promontory of Tainaron,
with its two capes of Matapan and Grasso—immense blocks of white marble more
than six hundred feet in height, upon which the quails settle in millions after their
fatiguing journey across the sea. Into the caverns at its foot the waters rush
with a dull noise which the ancients mistook for the barking of Cerberus.
Cape Matapan, like Malea, is dreaded amongst mariners as a great “destroyer
of men.”</p>

<p>The three southern extremities of the Peloponnesus are thus occupied by high
mountains and rocky declivities. The peninsula of Argolis, in the east, is likewise
traversed by mountain ranges, which start from Mount Cyllene, similarly to the
Gaurias and the mountains of Arcadia. The whole of the Peloponnesus is thus
a country of table-lands and mountain ranges. If we except the plains of Elis,
which have been formed by the alluvial deposits carried down by the rivers of
Arcadia, and the lake basins of the interior, which have been filled up in the
course of ages, we meet with nothing but mountains.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn16" id="fnanch16">16</a> The principal mountain
masses—the Cyllene, the Taygetus, and Parnon—are composed of crystalline
schists and metamorphic marbles, as in continental Greece. Strata of the Jurassic
age and beds of cretaceous limestone are here and there met with at the foot
of these more ancient rocks. Near the coast, in Argolis, and on the flanks of
the Taygetus, eruptions of serpentines and porphyries have taken place, whilst
on the north-eastern coast of Argolis, and especially on the small peninsula of
Methone, there exist recent volcanoes—amongst others, the Kaimenipetra, which
M. Fouqué identifies with the fire-vomiting mouths of Strabo, and which had its
last eruption twenty-one centuries ago. These volcanoes are, no doubt, the vents
of a submarine area of disturbance which extends through Milos, Santorin, and
Nisyros, to the south of the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>The sulphur springs which abound on the western coast of the Peloponnesus
are, perhaps, likewise evidences of a reaction of the interior of the earth.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of several geologists that the coasts of Western Greece are
being insensibly upheaved. In many places, and particularly at Corinth, we meet
with ancient caverns and sea beaches at an elevation of several feet above the sea-level.
It is this upheaval, and not merely the alluvial deposits brought down by
rivers, which explains the encroachment of the land upon the sea at the mouth of the
Achelous and on the coast of Elis, where four rocky islets have been joined to the
land. Elsewhere a subsidence of the land has been noticed,
as in the Gulf of <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
Marathonisi and on the eastern coast of Greece, where the ancient peninsula of
Elaphonisi has been converted into an island. But even there the fluvial deposits
have encroached upon the sea. The city of Calamata is twice as distant from the
seashore now as in the days of Strabo, and the traces of the ancient haven of
Helos, on the coast of Laconia, are now far inland.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The limestone rocks of the interior of the Peloponnesus abound as much in
chasms, which swallow up the rivers, as do Bœotia and the western portion of the
whole of the Balkan peninsula. Some of these katavothras are mere sieves, hidden
beneath herbage and pebbles, but others are wide chasms and caverns, through which
the course of the underground waters may be readily traced. In winter wild birds
post themselves at the entrances of these caverns, in expectation of the prey which
the river is certain to carry towards them; in summer, after the waters have
retired, foxes and jackals again take possession of their accustomed dens. The
water swallowed up by these chasms on the plateau reappears on the other side of
the mountains in the shape of springs, or <i>kephalaria</i> (<i>kephalovrysis</i>). The water
of these springs has been purified by its passage through the earth, and its
temperature is that of the soil. It bursts forth sometimes from a crevice in the
rocks, sometimes in an alluvial plain, and sometimes even from the bottom of the
sea. The subterranean geography of Greece is not yet sufficiently known to
enable us to trace each of these kephalaria to the katavothras which feed them.</p>

<p>The ancients were most careful in keeping open these natural funnels, for, by
facilitating the passage of the water, they prevented the formation of swamps.
These precautions, however, were neglected during the centuries of barbarism
which overcame Greece, and the waters were permitted to accumulate in many places
at the expense of the salubrity of the country. The plain of Pheneus, or Phonia, a
vast chasm between the Aroanian Mountains and the Cyllene, has thus repeatedly
been converted into a lake. In the middle of last century the whole
of this basin <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
was filled with water to a depth of more than 300 feet. In 1828, when this sheet of
water had already become considerably reduced, it was still 6 miles long and 150 feet
in depth. At length, a few years afterwards, the subterranean sluices opened,
the waters disappeared, and there remained only two small marshes near the places
of exit. But in 1850 the lake was again 200 feet in depth. Hercules, we are told,
constructed a canal to drain this valley and to cleanse its subterranean outlets, but
the inhabitants content themselves now with placing a grating above the “sink-holes,”
to prevent the admission of trunks of trees and of other large objects
carried along by the floods.</p>

<p>To the east of the valley of Pheneus, and on the southern foot of Mount Cyllene,
there is another lake basin, celebrated in antiquity because of the man-eating birds
which infested it, until they were exterminated by Hercules. This is the
Stymphalus, alternately lake and cultivated land. During winter the waters
cover about one-third of the basin; but it happens occasionally, after heavy rains,
that the lake resumes its ancient dimensions. There is only one katavothra through
which the waters can escape, and this, instead of being near the shore, as usual, is
at the bottom of the lake. It swallows up not only the water of the lake, but likewise
the vegetable remains carried into it, and the mud formed at its bottom; and
this detritus is conveyed through it to some subterranean cavity, where it putrefies
slowly, as may be judged from the fetid exhalations proceeding from the katavothra.
The water, however, is purified, and when it reappears on the surface,
close to the seashore, it is as clear as crystal.</p>

<p>There are many other lake basins of the same kind between the mountains of
Arcadia and the chain of the Gaurias. They all have their swamps or temporary
lakes, but the katavothras, in every instance, are sufficiently numerous to prevent
an inundation of the entire valley. The most important of these lake basins is
formed by the famous plain of Mantinea, upon which many a battle was fought.
From an hydrological point of view this is one of the most curious places in the
world; for the waters which collect there are discharged into two opposite seas—the
Gulf of Nauplia on the east, and in the direction of the Alpheus and the Ionian
Sea towards the west. There may exist even some subterranean rivulet which
discharges itself, towards the south, into the Eurotas and the Gulf of Laconia.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the waters underground has condemned to sterility several
parts of the Peloponnesus, which a little water would convert into the most fertile
regions of the globe. The surface waters quickly suck up and form subterranean
rivers, hidden from sight, which only see the light again, in most instances, near the
seashore, when it is impossible to utilise them. The plain of Argos, though surrounded
by a majestic amphitheatre of well-watered hills, is more sterile and arid
even than are Megara and Attica. Its soil is always dry, and soaks up water like
a sieve, which may have given rise to the fable of the Danaids. But to the south
of that plain, where there is but a narrow cultivable strip of land between the
mountains and the seashore, a great river bursts forth from the rocks. This is the
Erasinus.</p>

<p>Other springs burst forth at the southern extremity of the plain, close
to the defile <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
of Lerna, which, like that of the Erasinus, are supposed to be fed from Lake Stymphalus.
Close to them is a chasm filled with water, said to be unfathomable. It
abounds in tortoises, and venomous serpents inhabit the adjoining marsh. These
are the <i>kephalaria</i>, or “heads,” of the ancient hydra of Lerna, which Hercules
found it so difficult to seize hold of. Still farther south there is another spring
which rises from the bottom of the sea, more than three hundred yards from the
shore. This spring—the Doinæ of the ancients, and Anavula of modern Greek
mariners—is, in reality, but the mouth of one of the rivers swallowed up by the
katavothras of Mantinea. When the sea is still it throws up a jet rising to a
height of fifty feet.</p>

<p>Analogous phenomena may be witnessed in the two southern valleys of the
peninsula, those of Sparta and Messenia. The Iri, or Eurotas, is, in reality, but a large
rivulet, which discharges itself into the Gulf of Marathonisi, at the end
of a gorge, <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
through which the waters of the Lake of Sparta forced themselves a passage during
some ancient deluge; but it is only on rare occasions that its volume of water is
sufficient to remove the bar which obstructs its mouth. The Vasili-Potamo (“royal
river”), on the other hand, which bursts forth at the foot of a rock a short distance
from the Eurotas, though its whole course does not exceed five miles, discharges a
considerable volume of water throughout the year, and its mouth is at all times
open. As to the river of Messenia, the ancient Pamisus, now called Pirnatza, it is
the only river of Greece, besides the Alpheus, which forms a harbour at its mouth,
and it can be ascended by small vessels for a distance of eight miles; but this
advantage it owes exclusively to the powerful springs of Hagios Floros, which are
fed by the mountains on the east. These springs, which form a large swamp
where they rise to the surface, are the real river, if volume of water is to be decisive,
and the country watered and fertilised by them was called the “Happy” by the
ancients, on account of its fertility.</p>

<p>The western regions of the Peloponnesus receive more rain, and they are
likewise in the possession of the most considerable river, the Alpheus, now called
Ruphia, from one of its tributaries. The latter, the ancient Ladon, conveys a
larger volume of water towards the sea than the Alpheus. It was as celebrated
amongst the Greeks as was the Peneus of Thessaly, on account of the
transparency of its waters, and the smiling scenery along its banks. It is partly
fed by the snows of Mount Erymanthus, and, like most rivers of the Morea, derives
a portion of its waters from subterranean tributaries rising on the central plateau.
The Ladon thus receives the waters of Lake Phenea, whilst
the Alpheus proper <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
is fed in its upper course from katavothras on the shores of the ancient lakes
of Orchomenus and Mantinea. Having traversed the basin of Megalopolis, anciently
a lake, it passes through a series of picturesque gorges, and reaches its lower
valley. A charming tradition, illustrative of the ties of amity which existed
between Elis and Syracuse, makes this river plunge beneath the sea and reappear
in Sicily, close to the fountain of his beloved Arethusa. The ancient Greeks,
who witnessed the disappearance of so many rivers, would hardly have looked
upon this submarine course of the Alpheus as a thing to wonder at.</p>

<p>The Alpheus and all other rivers of Elis carry down towards the sea immense
masses of detritus, which they spread over the plains extending from the foot
of the mountains to the seashore. The ruins of Olympia disappeared in this
manner beneath alluvial deposits. They have all frequently changed their beds,
and not one amongst them has done so more frequently than the Peneus, or river of
Gastuni. Anciently it discharged its waters to the north of the rocky promontory
of Chelonatas, whilst in the present day it turns abruptly to the south, and enters
the sea at a distance of fifteen miles from its ancient mouth. Works of irrigation
may partly account for this change, but there can be no doubt that nature unaided
has by degrees much modified the aspect of this portion of Greece. Islands
originally far in the sea have been joined to the land; numerous open bays have
gradually been cut off from the sea by natural embankments, and transformed
into swamps or lagoons. One of the latter extends for several leagues to the
south of the Alpheus, and is divided from the sea by a fine forest of pines.
These majestic forests, in which the Triphylians paid honour to their dead, the
surrounding hills dotted over with clumps of trees, and Mount Lycæus, from
whose flanks are precipitated the cascades dedicated to Neda, the nurse of Jupiter,
render this the most attractive district of all the Morea to a lover of nature.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The Peloponnesus presents us with one of the most striking instances of the
influence exercised by the nature of the country upon the historical development
of its inhabitants. Held to Greece by a mere thread, and defended at its entrance
by a double bulwark of mountains, this “isle of Pelops” naturally became the
seat of independent tribes at a time when armies still recoiled from natural
obstacles. The isthmus was open as a commercial high-road, but it was closed
against invaders.</p>

<p>The relief of the peninsula satisfactorily explains the distribution of the
tribes inhabiting it, and the part they played in history. The whole of the interior
basin, which has no visible outlets towards the sea, naturally became the home
of a tribe who, like the Arcadians, held no intercourse with their neighbours, and
hardly any amongst themselves. Corinth, Sicyon, and Achaia occupied the seashore
on the northern slopes of the mountains, but were separated by high transversal
chains. The inhabitants of these isolated valleys long remained strangers
to each other, and when at length they combined to resist the invader, it was
too late. Elis, in the west, with its wide valleys and its insalubrious plains
extending along a coast having no havens, naturally played but
a secondary part <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
in the history of the peninsula. Its inhabitants, exposed to invasions, owing
to their country being without natural defences, would soon have been enslaved,
had they not placed themselves under the protection of all the rest of Greece
by converting their plain of Olympia into a place of meeting, where the Hellenes
of Europe and of Asia, from the continent and from the islands, met for a few
days’ festival to forget their rivalries and animosities. The basin of Argos and
the mountain peninsula of Argolis, on the eastern side of the Peloponnesus, on
the other hand, are districts having natural boundaries, and are easily defended.
Hence the Argolians were able to maintain their autonomy for centuries, and even
in the Homeric age they exercised a sort of hegemony over the remainder of
Greece. The Spartans were their successors. The country in which they
established themselves possessed the double advantage of being secure against
every attack, and of furnishing all they stood in need of. Having firmly
established themselves in the beautiful valley of the Eurotas, they found no
difficulty in extending their power to the seashore, and to the unfortunate Helos.
At a later date they crossed the heights of the Taygetus, and descended into the
plains of Messenia. That portion of Greece likewise formed a natural basin,
protected by elevated mountain ramparts; and the Messenians, who were kinsmen
of the Spartans and their equals in bravery, were thus able to resist for a century.
At length they fell, and all the Southern Peloponnesus acknowledged the supremacy
of Sparta, which was now in a position to assert its authority over the whole of
Greece. Then it was that the mountain-girt plateau on the road from Lacedæmonia
to Corinth, upon which stood the cities of Tegea and Mantinea, and which was
made by nature for a field of Mars, became the scene of strife.</p>

<p>The Peloponnesus, with its sinuous shores, forms a remarkable contrast to
Attica. Its characteristics are essentially those of a continent, and anciently
the Peloponnesians were mountaineers rather than mariners. Except in Corinth,
where the two seas nearly join, and a few towns of Argolis, which is another
Attica, there were no inducements for the inhabitants to engage in maritime
commerce; and in their mountain valleys and upland plains they were entirely
dependent upon the rearing of cattle and husbandry. Arcadia, in the centre
of the peninsula, was inhabited only by herdsmen and labourers; and its name,
which originally meant “country of bears,” has become the general designation
for an eminently pastoral country. The Laconians also, separated from the
sea by rocky mountains which hem in the valley of the Eurotas at its point of
issue, preserved for a long time the customs of warriors and of cultivators of
the soil, and took to the sea only with reluctance. “When the Spartans placed
Eurotas and Taygetus at the head of their heroes,” says Edgar Quinet, “they
distinctly connected the features of the valley with the destinies of the people
by whom it was occupied.”</p>

<p>In the very earliest ages the Phœnicians already occupied important factories
on the coasts of the Peloponnesus. They had established themselves at Nauplia,
in the Gulf of Argos; and at Cranaæ, the modern Marathonisi or Gythion, in
Laconia, they purchased the shells which they required to
dye their purple <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
cloths. The Greeks themselves were in possession of a few busy ports, amongst
which was “sandy Pylos,” the capital of Nestor, whose position is now held by
Navarino, on the other side of the gulf. At a subsequent date, when Greece had
become the centre of Me­di­ter­ra­nean commerce, Corinth, so favourably situated
between the two seas, rose into importance, not because of its political influence,
its cultivation of the arts, or love of liberty, but through the number and wealth
of its inhabitants. It is said that it had a population of three hundred thousand
souls within its walls. Even after it had been razed by the Romans it again
recovered its ancient pre-eminence. But the exposed position of the town has
caused it to be ravaged so many times that all commerce has fled from it. In 1858,
when an earthquake destroyed Corinth, that once famous city had dwindled down
into a poor village. The city has been rebuilt about five miles from its ancient site,
on the shore of the gulf named after it, but we doubt whether it will ever resume
its ancient importance unless a canal be dug to connect the two seas. The high-roads
from Marseilles and Trieste to Smyrna and Constantinople would then lead
across the Isthmus of Corinth, and this canal might attract an amount of shipping
equal to that which frequents other ocean channels or canals similarly situated.
But for the present the isthmus is almost deserted, and only the passengers who are
conveyed by Greek steamers to the small ports on its opposite shores cross it.
The ancients, who had failed in the construction of a canal, and who made no
further effort after the time of Nero, because they imagined one of the two seas
to be at a higher level than the other, had provided, at all events, a kind of
tramway, by means of which their small vessels could be conveyed from the Gulf
of Corinth to the Ægean Sea.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn17" id="fnanch17">17</a></p>

<p>After the Crusades, when the powerful Republic of Venice had gained a
footing upon the coasts of Morea, flourishing commercial colonies arose along
them, in Arcadia, on the island of Prodano (Prote), at Navarino, Modon, Coron,
Calamata, Malvoisie, and Nauplia in Argolis. At the call of these Venetian
merchants the Peloponnesus again became a seat of trade, and resumed, to some
extent, that part in maritime enterprise which it had enjoyed in the time
of the Phœnicians. But the advent of the Turk, the impoverishment of the soil,
and the civil wars which resulted therefrom, again forced the inhabitants to break
off all intercourse with the outer world, and to shut themselves up in their island
as in a prison. Tripolis, or Tripolitza, in the very centre of the peninsula, and
called thus, it is said, because it is the representative of three ancient cities—Mantinea,
Tegea, and Pallantium—then became the most populous place. Since
the Greeks have regained their independence life again fluctuates towards the seashore
as by a sort of natural sequence. Patras, close to the entrance of the Gulf of
Corinth, and near the most fertile and best-cultivated plains on the eastern shore,
is by far the most important city at present, and, in anticipation of its future
extension, the streets of a new town have been laid out, in the firm belief that it
will some day rival Smyrna and Trieste in extent. <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span></p>

<p>The other towns of the peninsula, even those which exhibited the greatest
activity during the dominion of the Venetians, are but of very secondary
importance, if we compare them with this emporium of the Peloponnesus. Ægium,
or Vostitza, on the Gulf of Corinth, is a poor port, less celebrated on account
of its commerce than in consequence of a magnificent plane-tree, more than
fifty feet in girth, the hollow trunk of which was formerly used as a prison.
Pyrgos, close to the Alpheus, has no port at all. The fine roadstead of Navarino,
defended against winds and waves by the rocky islet of Sphacteria, is but little
frequented, and the merchantmen riding at anchor there never outnumber the
Turkish men-of-war at the bottom, where they have lain since the battle fought in
1828. Modon and Coron have likewise fallen off. Calamata, at the mouth of the
fertile valleys of Messenia, has an open roadstead only, and vessels cannot
always ride in safety upon it. The celebrated Malvoisie, now called Monemvasia,
is hardly more than a heap of ruins, and the vineyards in its neighbourhood,
which furnished the exquisite wine named after the town, have long ceased
to exist. Nauplia, which was the capital of the modern kingdom of Greece
during the first few years of its existence, possesses the
advantage of a <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
well-sheltered port; but its walls, its bastions, and its
forts give it the character of a military town rather than
of a commercial one.</p>

<p>The towns in the interior of the country, whatever glories may attach to them,
are hardly more now than large villages. The most celebrated of all, Sparta, thanks
to the fertility of its environs, promises to become one of the most prosperous
cities of the interior of the Peloponnesus. Sparta—that is, the “scattered city,”—was
named thus because its houses were scattered over the plain, defended only
by the valour of their inhabitants, and not by walls. In the Middle Ages Sparta
was supplanted by the neighbouring Mistra, whose decayed Gothic buildings and
castles occupy a steep hill on the western side of the Eurotas; but it has now recovered
its supremacy amongst the towns of Laconia. Argos, which is more ancient
even than the city of Lacedæmon, has likewise risen anew from its ruins; for the
plain in which it lies, though occasionally dried up, is of great natural fertility.</p>

<p>Strangers, however, who explore the countries of the Peloponnesus, do not go
in search of these newly risen cities, where a few stones only remind them of
the glories of the past, but are attracted by the ancient monuments of art.
In that respect Argolis is one of the richest provinces of Greece. Near to Argos
the seats of an amphitheatre are cut into the steep flanks of the hill of Larissa.
Between Argos and Nauplia a small rock rises in the middle of the plain, which
is surmounted by the ancient Acropolis of Tiryns, the Cyclopean walls of which
are more than fifty feet in thickness. A few miles to the north of Argos are the
ruins of Mycenæ, the city of Agamemnon, where the celebrated “Gate of Lions,”
coarsely sculptured when Greek art first dawned, and the vast vaults known as
the Treasury of the Atrides, mainly attract the attention of visitors. These
vaults are amongst the oldest and best-preserved antiquities of Greece. They
exhibit most solid workmanship, and one of the stones, which does duty as a lintel
over the entrance-gate, weighs no less than one hundred and sixty-nine tons. At
Epidaurus, in Argolis, on the shores of the Gulf of Ægina, and close to the most
famous temple of Æsculapius, we still meet with a theatre which has suffered
less from time than any other throughout Greece. Shrubs, interspersed with
small trees, surround it; but we can still trace its fifty-four rows of white
marble seats, capable of affording accommodation to twelve thousand spectators.
Amongst other famous ruins of Argolis are the beautiful remains of a temple of
Jupiter at Nemea, and the seven Doric columns of Corinth, said to be the oldest
in all Greece. But the most beautiful edifice of the peninsula must be sought for
near Arcadian Phigalia, in the charming valley of the Neda. This is the temple
of Bassæ, erected by Ictinus in honour of Apollo Epicurius, and its beauty
is enhanced by the oaks and rocks which surround it.</p>

<p>Citadels, however, are the buildings we most frequently meet with; and many
a fortified place, with its walls and acropolis, yet exists as in the days of
ancient Greece. The walls of Phigalia and Messenia still have their ancient
towers, gates, and redoubts. Other fortifications were utilised by the Crusaders,
Venetians, or Turks, and by them furnished with crenellated walls and keeps,
which add another picturesque feature to the landscape. One
of these ancient <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
fortresses, transformed during the Middle Ages, rises at the very gates of
the Peloponnesus—namely, the citadel of Corinth, the strongest and most commanding
of all.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Several of the islands of the Ægean Sea must be looked upon as natural dependencies
of the Peloponnesus, to which submarine ledges or shoals attach them.</p>

<p>The islands along the coast of Argolis, which are inhabited by Albanian
seamen, who were amongst the foremost to fight the Turk during the struggle for
Hellenic independence, have lost much of their former commercial importance.
Poros, a small Albanian town on a volcanic island of the same name, which the
revolted people chose for their capital, is, however, still a bustling place, for
it has an excellent harbour, and the Greek Government has made it the principal
naval station of the kingdom. Hydra, on the other hand, and the small island
of Spezzia, next to it, have lost their former importance. They are both rocky
islands, without arable soil, trees, or water, and yet they formerly supported a
population of fifty thousand souls. About 1730 a colony of Albanians, weary of
the exactions of some Turkish pasha on the mainland, fled to the island of Hydra.
They were left in peace there, for they agreed to pay a trifling tribute. Their
commerce—leavened, to be sure, with a little piracy—assumed large dimensions,
and immediately before the war of independence the Albanians of Hydra owned
nearly 400 vessels of 100 to 200 tons each, and they were able to send over 200
vessels, armed with 200 guns, against the Turks. By engaging so enthusiastically
in this struggle for liberty, the Hydriotes, without suspecting it, wrought their own
ruin. No sooner was the cause of Greece triumphant than the commerce of Hydra
was transferred to Syra and the Piræus, which are more favourably situated.</p>

<p>Cythera of Laconia, a far larger island than either of those mentioned, and
better known by the Italian name of Cerigo, formed a member of the Septinsular
Republic, although not situated in the Ionian Sea, and clearly a dependency of
the Peloponnesus. Cythera is no longer the island of Venus, and its voluptuous
groves have disappeared. Seen from the north, it resembles a pile of sterile
rocks. It nevertheless yields abundant harvests, possesses fine plantations of
olive-trees, and populous villages. Cerigo, in former times, enjoyed considerable
importance, owing to its position between the Ionian Sea and the Archipelago;
but Cape Malea has lost its terrors now, and the harbour of refuge on the
island is no longer sought after. Heaps of shells, left there by Phœnician manufacturers
of purple, have been found on the island; and it was the Phœnicians
who introduced the worship of Venus Astarte.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Islands and islets are scattered in seeming disorder over the Ægean Sea, the
name of which may probably mean “sea of goats,” because these islands
appeared at a distance like goats. By a singular misapplication
the modern term <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
Archipelago, instead of sea, is now used to designate these groups of islands.
The Sporades, in the north, form a long range of islands stretching in the

Achilles and place of exile of King Theseus, occupies an isolated position; the
large island of Eubœa extends along the coast of the continent; and in the
distance rise the white mountains of the Cyclades, likened by the ancient Greeks
to a circle of Oceanides dancing around a deity.</p>

<p>All these islands are so many fragments of the mainland. This is proved by
their geological structure, or by shoals which attach them to the nearest coast. The
Northern Sporades are a branch of Mount Pelion. Eubœa is traversed by limestone
mountains of considerable height, running parallel to the chains of Attica,
Argolis, Mount Olympus, and Mount Athos. Scyros is a rocky mountain mass,
whose axis runs in the same direction as that of the central chain of Eubœa.
The summits of the Cyclades continue the ranges of Eubœa and Attica towards
the south-east, and the same micaceous and argillaceous schists, limestones, and
crystalline marbles are found in them. They are, indeed,
“mountains of Greece <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
scattered over the sea.” If Athens may boast of the quarries of Mount Pentelicus,
the Cyclades produce the glittering marbles of Naxos, and the still more beautiful
ones of Paros, from which were chiselled the statues of heroes and of gods.
Curious caverns are met with in the limestone of the islands, especially that of
Antiparos, the existence of which was not known to the ancients, and the Cave of
Sillaka, on the island of Cythnos, or Thermia, celebrated for its hot springs.
Granite is found on some of the islands, and particularly in the small island of
Delos, dedicated to the worship of Apollo and Diana. In the south, finally,
the Cyclades are traversed by a chain of volcanic islands, extending from the
peninsula of Methana, in Argolis, to Cos and the shores of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Eubœa may be looked upon almost as a portion of the continent, for the strait
which separates it from the mainland resembles a submerged longitudinal valley,
and is nowhere of great depth or width. At its narrowest part it is no more
than two hundred and fourteen feet across, and from the most remote times,
Chalcis, the capital of the island, has been joined to the mainland by a bridge.
The irregular tidal currents flowing through this strait were looked upon as
marvellous by the Greeks, and Aristotle is said to have flung himself into it
because he was unable to explain this phenomenon. The Italian name of the
island, Negroponte, is formed by a series of corruptions from Euripus, by which
name the ancients knew the strait between the island and the mainland. Eubœa
has at all times shared in the vicissitudes of the neighbouring provinces of Attica
and Bœotia. When the cities of Greece were at the height of their glory, those
of Eubœa—Chalcis, Eretria, and Cerinthus—enjoyed likewise a high degree of
prosperity, and dispatched colonies to all parts of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. Later on,
when invaders ravaged Attica, Eubœa shared the same fate, and at present it
participates in every political and social movement of the neighbouring continent.</p>

<p>In Northern Eubœa there are forests of oaks, pines, elms, and plane-trees;
the villages are embedded in orchards; and the surrounding country resembles
what we have seen in Elis and Arcadia. But in the Cyclades we look in vain for
charming landscapes. Foliage and running water abound only in a very few
spots. Arid rocks, more arid even than those on the coast of Greece, predominate,
and only in a few favoured spots do we meet with a few olive-trees, valonia
oaks, pines, and fig-trees. Everywhere else the hills are naked. And yet these
islands arouse feelings of devotion in us, for their names are great in history.
The highest summits of most of them have been named after the prophet
Elias, the biblical successor of Apollo, the god of the sun; and justly so, for the
sun reigns supreme upon these austere rocks, and his scorching rays destroy every
vestige of vegetation.</p>

<p>Antimilos, one of the uninhabited islands of this group, still affords an asylum
to the wild goat (<i>Capra Caucasica</i>), which has disappeared from the remainder of
Europe, and is met with only in Crete, and perhaps Rhodes. Wild pigs likewise
haunt the rocks of Antimilos. Rabbits were introduced from the West, and abound
in the caverns of some of the Cyclades, and especially on Myconus and Delos.
The ancient authors never mention these animals. It is a
curious fact that <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
hares and rabbits never inhabit the same island, with the sole exception of
Andros, where the hares occupy the extreme north, whilst the rabbits have their
burrows in the southern portion of the island. As a curiosity, we may also
mention that a large species of lizard, called crocodile by the inhabitants, is found
on the islands, but not on the neighbouring continent, and we may conclude from
this that the Cyclades were separated from the Balkan peninsula at a very remote
period.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>A chain of volcanic islands bounds the Cyclades towards the south, where they
are separated from Crete by an ocean trough of great depth. Milos is the most
important of these islands. It has an irregularly shaped crater, which has been
invaded by the sea, and forms there one of the safest and most capacious harbours
of refuge in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. Milos has had no eruption within historic times,
but the existence of solfataras and of hot springs proves that its volcanic forces are
not yet quite extinct.</p>

<p>The actual centre of volcanic activity has to be looked for in a small group of
islands known as Santorin, and lying midway between Europe and Asia. These
islands consist of marbles and schists, similar to those of the other Cyclades, and
they surround a vast crater no less than twelve hundred and eighty feet in depth.
The crescent-shaped island of Thera, on the east, presents bold cliffs towards the
crater, while its gentle outer slopes are covered with vineyards producing exquisite
wine. Therasia, on the west, rises like an immense wall; and
the islet of <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
Aspronisi, between the two, indicates the existence of a submarine partition wall
which separates the crater from the open sea. The submarine volcano occupies
the centre of this basin. It remains quiescent for long periods, and then
suddenly arousing itself, it ejects immense masses of scoriæ. Nearly twenty-one
centuries ago the first island rose to the surface in the centre of this basin. This
island is known now as Palæa Kammeni, or the “old volcano.” Three years of
eruptions in the sixteenth century gave birth to the smallest of the three islands,
Mikra Kammeni. A third cone of lava, Nea Kammeni, rose in the eighteenth
century; and quite recently, between 1866 and 1870, this new island has more
than doubled its size, overwhelming the small village of Volkario and its port, and
extending to within a very short distance of Mikra Kammeni. No less than half
a million of partial eruptions occurred during those five years, and the ashes were
sometimes thrown to a height of four thousand feet. Even from Crete clouds of
ashes could be seen suspended in the air, black during the day, and lit up by night.</p>

<p>Thousands of spectators hastened to Santorin from all quarters of the world to
witness these eruptions, and amongst them were several men of science—Fouqué,
Gorceix, Reiss, Stübel, and Schmidt—whose observations have proved of great
service. The crater of Santorin appears to have been produced by a violent
explosion which shattered the centre of the ancient island, and covered its slopes
with enormous masses of tufa.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn18" id="fnanch18">18</a></p>

<p>Southern Eubœa and the vicinity of Port Gavrion, on the island of Andros,
are inhabited by Albanians, but the population in the remainder of the Archipelago
is Greek. The families of Italian or French descent on Scyros, Syra,
Naxos, and Santorin are not sufficiently numerous to constitute an element of
importance. They claim to be of French descent, and are known in the Archipelago
as Franks, and during the war of independence they claimed the protection
of the French Government. In former times nearly the whole of the
land was held by these Franks, who had taken possession of it during the Middle
Ages, and these large estates are made to account for the sparse population of
Naxos, which supported a hundred thousand inhabitants formerly, but is now
hardly able to support one-seventh that number.</p>

<p>The Cyclades are farther removed from the coast of Greece than Eubœa, and
they have not always shared in the historical dramas enacted upon the neighbouring
continent. Their position in the centre of the Archipelago naturally
caused them to be visited by all the nations navigating the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and
their inhabitants were thus subjected to the most diverse influences. In ancient
times the mariners of Asia Minor and of Phœnicia called at the Cyclades on their
voyages to Greece; during the Middle Ages the Byzantines, the Crusaders, the
Venetians, the Genoese, the Knights of Rhodes, and the
Osmanli were masters <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
there in turn; and in our own days the nations of Western Europe, with the
Greeks themselves, hold the preponderance in the Archipelago.</p>

<p>These historical vicissitudes have caused the centre of gravity of the Cyclades
to be shifted from island to island. In the time of the ancient Greeks, Delos, the
island of Apollo, was looked upon as the “holy land,” where merchants congregated
from all quarters, carried on business in the shadow of sanctuaries, and
held slave markets at the side of the temples. The sale of human flesh became
in the end the main feature of the commerce of Delos, and in the time of the
Roman emperors as many as ten thousand slaves were bartered away there in a
single day. But the markets, the temples, and monuments of Delos have vanished,
and its stony soil supports now only a few sheep. During the Middle Ages Naxos
enjoyed the predominance; and at present, Tinos, with its venerated church
of the Panagia and its thousands of pilgrims, is the “holy land” of the Archipelago;
whilst Hermopolis, on Syra, though without trees or water, holds the
position of commercial metropolis of the Cyclades. The latter was a town of no
importance before the war of independence; but it remained neutral during that
struggle, and thus attracted numerous refugees from other islands, and, thanks to
its central position, it has since become the principal mart, dockyard, and naval
station of the Ægean Sea. Whether travellers proceed to Saloniki, Smyrna,
Constantinople, or the Black Sea, they must stop at Hermopolis. The town
formerly occupied the heights only, for fear of pirates, but it has descended now
to the foot of the hill, and its quays and warehouses extend along the seashore.</p>

<p>Commerce has peopled the naked rocks of Syra, but it has not yet succeeded in
developing the resources of the Archipelago as in ancient times. Eubœa is no
longer “rich in cattle,” as its name implies, and only exports corn, wine, fruit,
and the lignite extracted from the mines near Kumi. The gardens of Naxos
yield oranges, lemons, and citrons; Scopelos, Andros, and Tinos, the latter one of
the best cultivated amongst the islands, export wines, which are excelled, however,
by those of Santorin, the Calliste of the earliest Greeks. The volcanic and other
islands of the Cyclades export millstones, china clay, lavas, and cimolite, this being
used in bleaching. Naxos exports emery, and that is all. The marbles of Paros
even remain untouched, and the excellent harbour of that island only rarely sees a
vessel. The inhabitants of the Cyclades confine themselves to the cultivation of
the soil, and to the breeding of a few silkworms, the surplus population of Tinos,
Siphnos, and others emigrating annually to Constantinople, Smyrna, or Greece, to
work as labourers, cooks, potters, masons, or sculptors. But whilst some of the
islands can boast of a surplus population, there are others which are the abode of
a few herdsmen only. Most of the islands between Naxos and Amorgos are
hardly more than barren rocks. Antimilos, like Delos, is merely a pasture-ground
sown over with rocks. Seriphos and Giura are still dreary solitudes, as in
the time of the Roman emperors, when they were set aside as places of exile.
Seriphos, however, possesses iron of excellent quality, and may, in consequence,
again become of some importance. On Antiparos there
are lead mines. <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">The island of Corfu, on the coast of Epirus, and the whole of the Archipelago
to the west of continental and peninsular Greece, down to the island of Cythera,
which divides the waters of the Ionian Sea from those of the Ægean, have
passed through the most singular political vicissitudes in the course of the last
century. Corfu, thanks to the protection extended to it by the Venetian Republic,
is the only dependency of the Balkan peninsula which successfully resisted the
assaults of the Turk. When Venice was handed over to the Austrians by
Bonaparte in 1797, Corfu and the Ionian Islands were occupied by the French.
A few years afterwards the Russians became the virtual masters in these islands,
which they formed into a sort of aristocratic republic under the suzerainty of
the Porte. In 1807 the French once more took possession of them; but the
English captured one after the other until there remained to them only Corfu,
and this, too, had to be given up in 1814. The Ionian Islands were then converted
into a “Septinsular Republic,” governed by the landed aristocracy, supported by
British bayonets. Twice did England alter the constitution of this republic in a
democratic sense, but the patriotism of the islanders refused to submit to British
suzerainty; and, when Great Britain parted with her conquest, the Ionian Islands
annexed themselves to Greece, and they now form the best educated, the
wealthiest, and the most industrious portion of that kingdom. England, no doubt,
consulted her own interests when she set free her Ionian subjects; but her action
is nevertheless deserving of approbation. England exhibited her faith in the
axiom that moral influence is superior to brute force, and yielded with perfect
good grace, not only the commercial ports of the islands, but likewise the citadel
of Corfu, which gave her the command of the Adriatic. This magnanimous
policy has not hitherto met with imitators in other countries, but England herself
has still many opportunities of applying it in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Corfu, the ancient Corcyra, has always held the foremost place amongst the
Ionian Islands. It owes this position to the vicinity of Italy, and to the commercial
advantages derived from an excellent port and a vast roadstead almost
resembling an inland lake. The inhabitants are fond of appealing to Thucydides
in order to prove that Corfu is the island of the Phæaces of Ulysses. They even
pretend to have discovered the rivulet in which beauteous Nausicaa washed the
linen of her father, and the shaded walks near the city are known by them as the
gardens of Alcinous. Corfu is the only one of the islands which can boast of a
small perennial stream, the Messongi, which is navigable for a short distance in
barges. The hills, which are placed like a screen in front of the plains of the
Epirus, are exposed to the full force of the south-westerly winds, which bring
much rain; the vegetation, consequently, is rich: orange and lemon trees form
fragrant groves around the city, vines and olive-trees hide the barren ground of
the hills, and waving fields of corn cover the plains. Corfu, unfortunately, is
exposed to the hot sirocco, blowing from the south-east, and this very much
curtails its advantages as a winter
station for invalids. <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span></p>

<p>The city occupies a triangular peninsula opposite the coast of the Epirus,
and is the largest, and commercially the most important, of the former republic.
It is strongly fortified, and its successive possessors—Venetians, French, Russians,
and English—have sought to render it impregnable. A beautiful prospect may
be enjoyed from its bastions; but far superior is that from Mount Pantokratoros,
the “commandant,” for it extends across the Strait of Otranto to Italy. The
commercial relations with the latter, as well as the traditions of Venetian
dominion, have converted Corfu into a city almost half Italian, and numerous
families residing in it belong to both nations, the Greek and the Italian, by
descent as well as language. Italian remained the official language of the island
until 1830. Maltese porters and gardeners constitute a prominent element amongst
the cosmopolitan population of the city.</p>

<p>Corfu formerly owned the town of Butrinto and a few villages on the mainland;
but an English governor thought fit to surrender them to the
terrible Ali Pasha, <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
and the only dependencies of Corfu at present are the small islets near it, viz.
Othonus (Fano), Salmastraci, and Ericusa, in the north; Paxos, with its caverns,
and Antipaxos, the rocks of which exude asphalt, on the south. Paxos is said to
produce the best oil in Western Greece.</p>

<p>Leucadia, Cephalonia, Ithaca, Zante, and a few smaller islands, form a
crescent-shaped archipelago off the entrance to the Gulf of Patras. They are
the summits of a half-submerged chain of calcareous mountains, alternately
flooded by the rains or scorched by the sun. Their valleys, like those of Corfu,
produce oranges, lemons, currants (“Corinthians”), wine, and oil, which form the
objects of a brisk commerce. The inhabitants very much resemble those of Corfu,
the Italian element being strongly represented, except on Ithaca.</p>

<p>Leucadia, or the “white island,” thus called because of its glittering chalk
cliffs, is evidently a dependency of the continent. The ancients looked upon it as
a peninsula converted into an island by Corinthian colonists, who cut a canal
through the isthmus which joined it to the mainland; but this legend is not
borne out by an examination of the locality. These Corinthians probably merely
dug a navigable channel through the shallow lagoon which separates the island
from the coast, and does not exceed eighteen inches in depth. In fact, if there
were any tides in the Ionian Sea, the island of Leucadia would be converted twice
daily into a peninsula. A bridge, of which there still exist considerable
remains, formerly joined the island to the mainland near the southern extremity
of the lagoon, whilst an island occupied by the citadel of Santa Maura—a name
sometimes applied to the whole of the island—defended its entrance
to the north. <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
Until recently this was the only spot in Western Greece where a grove of date-trees
might be seen. A magnificent aqueduct of two hundred and sixty arches, which
was also used as a viaduct, joined the citadel to Amaxiki, the chief town and harbour
of Leucadia. This monument of Turkish enterprise—it was constructed in the
reign of Bajazet—has sustained much injury from earthquakes. Amaxiki might
be supposed to be haunted by fever, owing to the salt swamps and lagoons which
surround it; but such is not the case: on the contrary, it is a comparatively
healthy town, and its women are noted for freshness of complexion and beauty.
To the south of it rise the wooded mountains which terminate in the promontory
of Leucate (Dukato), opposite to Cephalonia. On the summit of this promontory
stood a temple of Apollo, whence, at the annual festival of the god, a condemned
criminal was hurled as an expiatory victim. It was celebrated, also, as the lover’s
leap, whence lovers leaped into the sea to drown their passion.</p>

<p>Cephalonia, or rather Cephallenia, is the largest of the Ionian Islands, and its
highest summit—Mount Ænus, or Elato—is the culminating point of the entire
Archipelago. Mariners from the centre of the Ionian Sea can see at one and the
same time Mount Ætna in Sicily and this mountain of Cephalonia. The forests of
conifers, to which the latter is indebted for its Italian name of Montenero, have for
the greater part been destroyed by fire, but there still remain a few clumps of
magnificent firs. On its summit may be seen the remains of a temple of Jupiter.
The island is fertile and populous, but suffers much from want of water. All its
rivers dry up in summer, the calcareous soil sucking up the rain, and most of the
springs rise from the bottom of the sea, far away from the fields thirsting after
water. On the other hand, two considerable streams of sea-water find their way
into the bowels of the island.</p>

<p>This curious phenomenon occurs a short distance to the north of Argostoli, a
bustling town, having a safe but shallow harbour. The two oceanic rivers are
sufficiently powerful to set in motion the huge wheels of two mills, one of which
has been regularly at work since 1835, and the other since 1859. Their combined
discharge amounts to 35,000,000 gallons daily, and naturalists have not yet
decided whether they form a vast subterranean lake, in which beds of salt are
constantly being deposited, or whether they find their way through numerous
threads, and, by hydrostatic aspiration, into the subterranean rivers of the island,
rendering their water brackish. The latter is the opinion of Wiebel, the geologist,
and thus much we may assume for certain—that these subterranean waters and
caverns are one of the principal causes of the severe earthquakes which visit
Cephalonia so frequently. The island of Asteris, between Cephalonia and Ithaca,
upon which stood the city of Alalkomenæ, exists no longer, and was probably
destroyed by one of those earthquakes.</p>

<p>Ithaca of “divine Ulysses,” the modern Theaki, is separated from Cephalonia
by the narrow channel of Viscardo, thus named after Robert Guiscard. The
island is small, and all the sites referred to in the Odyssey are still pointed out
there, from the spring of Arethusa to the acropolis of Ulysses; but the black forests
which clothed the slopes of Mount Neritus have disappeared.
The inhabitants are <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
excessively proud of their little island, rendered so famous by the poetry of Homer,
and in every family we meet with a Penelope, a Ulysses, and a Telemachus. But
the present inhabitants have no claim whatever to be the descendants of the crafty
son of Laertes, for during the Middle Ages their ancestors were exterminated by
invaders, and in 1504 the deserted fields were given, by the Senate of Venice, to
colonists drawn from the mainland. Most of those immigrants came from the Epirus,
and the dialect spoken by the islanders is much mixed with Albanian words. At
the present time the island is well cultivated, and Vathy, its chief port, carries on
a brisk commerce in raisins, currants, oil, and wine. Ithaca, as in the days of
Homer, is the “nurse of valiant men.” The inhabitants are tall and strong, and
Dr. Schliemann is enthusiastic about the high standard of virtue and morality prevailing
amongst them. There are neither rich nor poor, but they are great
travellers, and natives of Ithaca are met with in every populous city of the East.</p>

<p>“Zante, fior del Levante,” say the Italians. And, indeed, this ancient island,
Zacynthus, is richer in orchards, fields, and villas than any other of this Archipelago.
An extensive plain, bounded by ranges of hills, occupies the centre of this
“golden isle”—a vast garden, abounding in vines, yielding currants of superior
quality. The inhabitants are industrious, and not content with cultivating their
own fields, they assist also in the cultivation of those of Acarnania, receiving
wages or a share of the produce in return. The city of Zante, on the eastern coast
of the island, facing Elis, is the wealthiest and cleanest town
in the Archipelago. <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
Unfortunately it suffers frequently from earthquakes, to which a volcanic origin is
ascribed. Nor is this improbable, for bituminous springs rise near the south-eastern
cape of the island, and though worked since the days of Herodotus, they still yield
about a hundred barrels of pitch annually. Oil springs discharge themselves close
to the shore, and even at the bottom of the sea; and near Cape Skinari, in the
north, a kind of rank grease floats on the surface of the waters.</p>

<p>The only islets dependent upon Zante are the Strivali, or the Strophades, to
which flew the hideous harpies of ancient mythology.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn19" id="fnanch19">19</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">The Greeks, although they have not altogether fulfilled the expectations of
Philhellenes, have nevertheless made great strides in advance since they have
thrown off the yoke of the Turks. The deeds of valour performed during the war
of independence recalled the days of Marathon and Platæa; but it was wrong to
expect that a short time would suffice to raise modern Greece to the intellectual
and artistic level of the generation which gave birth to an Aristotle and a
Phidias. Nor can we expect that a nation should throw off, in a single generation,
the evil habits engendered during an age of servitude, and digest at once the
scientific conquests made in the course of twenty centuries. We should likewise
bear in mind that the population of Greece is small, and that it is thinly scattered
over a barren mountain region. The numerous ports, no doubt, offer great facilities
for commerce, nor have their inhabitants failed to avail themselves of them; but
there is hardly a country in Europe which offers equal obstacles to a development
of its agricultural and industrial resources. The construction of roads, owing to
the mountains, meets with difficulties everywhere, whilst the blue sea invites its
beholders to distant climes and commercial expeditions. No immigration from the
neighbouring Turkish provinces has consequently taken place, whilst many
Hellenes, and more especially natives of the Ionian Islands and the Cyclades,
annually seek their fortune in Constantinople, Cairo, and even distant India. Men
of enterprise leave the country, and there remains behind only a horde of intriguers,
who look upon politics as a lucrative business, and an army of government officials,
who depend upon the favour of a minister for future promotion. This state of
affairs explains the singular fact that the most prosperous Greek communities exist
beyond the borders of the kingdom of Greece. These foreign communities are
better and more liberally governed than those at home. In spite of the Pasha,
who enjoys the right of supervision, the administration of
the smallest Greek <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
community in Thracia or Macedonia might serve as a pattern to the independent and
sovereign kingdom of Greece. Every one there takes an interest in the prosperity
of the commonwealth; but in Greece a rapacious bureaucracy takes care only of its
own advancement, the electors are bribed, and the expenses thus illegally incurred
are recovered by illegal exactions and robbery, such as have prevailed for many
years.</p>

<p>The actual population of Greece may amount to 1,500,000 souls; that is to say,
it includes about two-fifths of all the Greeks residing in Europe and Asia. The
population is less dense than in any other country of Europe, including Turkey.
Greece, at the epoch of its greatest prosperity, is said to have supported 6,000,000
or 7,000,000 inhabitants. Attica was ten times more populous at that time, and
many islands which now support only a few herdsmen could then boast of
populous towns. Sites of ancient cities abound on the barren plateaux, on the
banks of the smallest rivulet, and crown every promontory throughout the ancient
countries of the Hellenes, from Cyprus to Corfu, and from Thasos to Crete.</p>

<p>The country, however, is being gradually repeopled. Before the war of independence,
the population, including the Ionian Islands, amounted, perhaps, to
1,000,000; but battles and massacres diminished it considerably, and in 1832 the
number of inhabitants was 950,000 at most. Since that epoch there has been an
annual increase varying between 9,000 and 14,000 souls. This increase, however,
is spread very unequally over the country. The towns increase rapidly, but
several islands, and more especially Andros, Santorin, Hydra, Zante, and Leucadia,
lose more inhabitants by emigration than they gain by an excess of births over
deaths. The swamp fevers prevailing in continental Greece much retard the
increase of population. Naturally the climate is exceedingly salubrious, but the
water, in many localities, has been permitted to collect into pestilential swamps,
and the draining of these and their cultivation would not only add to the wealth
of the country, but would likewise free it from a dire plague.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn20" id="fnanch20">20</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately agriculture progresses but slowly in Greece, and its produce is
not even sufficient to support the population, still less to supply articles for export.
And yet the cultivable soil of Greece is admirably suited to the growth of vines,
fruits, cotton, tobacco, and madder. Figs and oranges are delicious; the wines of
Santorin and the Cyclades are amongst the finest produced in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean;
the oil of Attica is as superior now as when Athene planted
the sacred olive-tree; <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
but, excepting a little cotton grown in Phthiotis, and the raisins known as
currants or Corinthians, which are exported from the Ionian Islands and Patras
to the annual value of about £1,500,000, agriculture contributes but little
towards the exports. One of the principal articles is the valonia, a species of acorn
picked up in the forests, and used by tanners.</p>

<p>In a country so far behindhand in agriculture manufactures cannot be
expected to flourish. All manufactured articles have consequently to be imported
from abroad, and especially from England. Greece does not even possess tools to
work its famous marble quarries, though they are richer than those of Carrara.
There is only one metallurgical establishment in the whole of the kingdom—that
of Laurion. The ancients had been working argentiferous lead mines in that
part of the country for centuries, and vast masses of unexhausted slag had
accumulated near them. This waste is now being scientifically treated in the
smelting-works of Ergastiria, and nearly ten thousand tons of lead, and a considerable
quantity of silver, are produced there annually. Quite a brisk little town
has arisen near the works, and its harbour is one of the busiest in all Greece.
But the founders of this flourishing concern had to struggle against jealousies,
and the “Laurion question” nearly embroiled the Governments of France and
Italy with Greece.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn21" id="fnanch21">21</a></p>

<p>The Greeks do not support themselves by agriculture, nor can they boast
of manufactories, and they would be doomed to starvation if they did not maintain
six thousand vessels acting in the lucrative business of ocean carriers throughout
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. This Greek mercantile marine is superior to that of Russia,
almost equal to that of Austria, and six times larger than that of Belgium, and
we should bear in mind that many vessels sailing under Turkish colours are
actually owned by Greeks. The ancient instinct of the race comes out strongly
in this coast navigation. The large fleets of swift ocean steamers belong to the
powerful companies of the West, and the Greeks are content to sail in small
vessels suited to the requirements of the coasting trade, which hardly ever
extend their voyages beyond the limits of the ancient Greek world. None can
compete with them as regards low freight, for every sailor has an interest in the
cargo, and all of them are anxious to increase the profits. One may have
furnished the wood, another the rigging, a third a portion of the cargo, whilst
their fellow-citizens have advanced money for the purchase of merchandise,
without requiring any bond except their word of honour. On many of these
vessels all are partners, all work alike, and share in the proceeds of the venture.</p>

<p>But, whatever the sobriety and intelligence of these Greek mariners, they
cannot escape the fate which has overtaken the small trader and the handicraftsman
throughout the world. The cheap vessels of the Greeks may be able to contend
for a long time against the steamers of powerful companies, but in the end they
must succumb. The country will lose its place amongst the commercial nations
of the world unless its agricultural and industrial
resources are quickly developed, <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span>
and railways are constructed to convey the products of the interior to the sea-coast.
Greece, even now, has only a few carriage roads, not so much because the
mountains offer insurmountable obstacles, but because its heedless inhabitants
are content with the facilities for transport offered by the sea. It would be
impossible in our day to travel from the Pylos to Lacedæmon in a chariot, as was
done by Telemachus; for the road connecting these places leads along precipices
and over dangerous goat paths. Greece and Servia are the European states
which remained longest without a railway, and even now the former is content
with a short line connecting Athens with its harbour. It has certainly been
proposed to construct several lines of the utmost importance, but, owing to the
bankrupt condition of the Greek exchequer, these works have not yet been begun.
The public income is not sufficient to meet the expenditure, the debt exceeds
£15,000,000, and the interest on the loans remains unpaid.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn22" id="fnanch22">22</a></p>

<p>The poverty of the majority of the inhabitants of Greece is equal to that of
the State. The peasants are impoverished by the payment of tithes, and of a
Government impost double or even treble their amount. Though naturally very
temperate, they are hardly able to sustain life; they dwell in unwholesome dens,
and are frequently unable to put by sufficient means for the purchase of clothing
and other necessaries. The young men of the poorest districts of Greece thus
find themselves forced to emigrate in large numbers, either for a season or for
an indefinite period. Arcadia may be likened in this respect to Auvergne,
to Savoy, and to other mountain countries of Central Europe. The Ætolians,
however, exchange their fine savage valleys for foreign cities only very reluctantly,
though they, too, suffer intensely from the weight of taxation. In ancient times,
before their spirit was broken by servitude, they would have resisted the tax-gatherer
with arms in their hands. They now content themselves with sallying
forth from their villages, in order to pile up a heap of stones by the side of the
high-road, as a testimony of the injustice with which they have been treated.
This heap of stones is <i>anathema</i>. Every peasant passing it religiously adds a
stone to this mute monument of execration, and the earth, the common mother of
all, is thus charged with the task of vengeance.</p>

<p>Ignorance, the usual attendant of poverty, is great in the rural districts of
Greece, and especially in those difficult of access. In Greece, as in Albania and
Montenegro, they believe in perfidious nymphs, who secure the affections of young
men, and then drag them down below the water; they believe in vampyres, in
the evil eye and witchcraft. But the Greeks are an inquiring race, anxious
to learn, in spite of their poverty. The peasant of Ithaca will stop a traveller of
education on the road, in order that he may read to him the poetry of Homer.
Elementary schools have been established in nearly every village, in spite of the
poverty of the Government. If no school buildings can be secured, the classes
meet in the open air. The scholars, far from playing truant, hardly raise their
eyes from the books to notice a passing stranger or the flight of a bird. The
scholars in the superior schools and at the University of
Athens are equally <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
conscientious and assiduous. It may be that some of them merely aspire to become
orators, but they certainly do not resort to a city on the pretence of study,
whilst in reality they yield themselves up to debauchery. Amongst the students
of the University of Athens there are many who work half the night at some
handicraft, others who hire themselves out as servants or coachmen, to enable
them to pursue their studies as lawyers or physicians.</p>

<p>This love of study cannot fail to secure to the Greek nation an intellectual
influence far greater than could be looked for from the smallness of its
numbers. The Greeks of the East, moreover, look upon Athens as their intellectual
centre, whither they send their sons in pursuit of knowledge. They found
scholarships in connection with the schools of Athens, and largely contribute
towards their support. And it is not only the rich Greek merchants of Trieste,
Saloniki, Smyrna, Marseilles, and London who are thus mindful of the true
interests of their native country, but peasants of Thracia and Macedonia, too,
devote their savings to the promotion of public education. The people themselves
support their schools and museums, and pay their professors. The Academy of
Athens, the Polytechnic School, the University, and the Arsakeion, an excellent
ladies’ college—these all owe their existence to the zeal of Greek citizens, and not
to the Government. It may readily be understood from this how carefully these
institutions are being watched by the entire nation, and how salutary must be the
influence of young men and women returning to their native provinces after they
have been educated at them.</p>

<p>It is thus a common language, common traditions, and a common hope for the
future that have made a nation of the Greeks in spite of treaties. Greek
patriotism is not confined to the narrow limits laid down by diplomacy. Whether
they reside in Greece proper, in European or Asiatic Turkey, the Greeks feel as
one people, and they lead a common national life independently of the Governments
of Constantinople and Athens. Nay, amongst the Greeks dwelling in
foreign lands this feeling of nationality is, perhaps, most intense, for they are not
exposed to the corrupting influence of a bureaucracy. They have more carefully
guarded the traditions and practices of municipal government, and are practically
in the enjoyment of greater individual liberty. The Greek nation, in its entirety,
numbers close upon 4,000,000 souls. Its power, already considerable, is growing
from day to day, and is sure to exercise a potent influence upon the destinies of
Me­di­ter­ra­nean Europe.</p>

<p>We are told sometimes that community of religion might induce the Greeks
to favour Russian ambition, and to open to that power the road to Constantinople.
Nothing can be further from the truth. The Hellenes will never sacrifice their
own interests to those of the foreigner. Nor do there exist between Greece and
Russia those natural ties which alone give birth to true alliances. Climate,
geographical position, history, commerce, and, above all, a common civilisation,
attach Greece to that group of European nations known as Greco-Latin. In
tripartite Europe the Greeks will never range themselves by the side of the
Slav, but will be found amongst the Latin nations of Italy,
France, and Spain.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The protecting powers
have bestowed upon Greece a parliamentary and constitutional
Government, modelled upon West European patterns. Theoretically
the King of the Greeks reigns, but does not govern, and his ministers are
responsible to the Chambers, whose majority changes with the fluctuations of
public opinion. In reality, however, the power of the King is limited only
by diplomacy. Nor do those Western institutions respond to the traditions
and the genius of the Greeks, and although the charter has been modified
three times since the declaration of independence, it has never been strictly
adhered to.</p>

<p>In accordance with the constitution of 1864, every Greek citizen possessing
any property whatever, or exercising a profession, has a right to vote on attaining
his twenty-fifth year, and becomes eligible as a deputy at thirty. The deputies,
one hundred and eighty-seven in number, are elected for four years, and are paid
for their services. The civil list of the King, inclusive of a subvention granted by
the protecting powers, amounts to £46,000 a year.</p>

<p>The orthodox Greek Church of Hellas is independent of the Patriarch of
Constantinople. It is governed by a Holy Synod, sitting in the capital, and
presided over by an archbishop as metropolitan. A royal commissioner is present
at the meetings of the Synod, and countersigns every proposition that is carried.
Decisions not bearing this official signature are void. The King, on the other
hand, is permitted to dethrone or remove a bishop only by consent of the Synod,
and in accordance with the canon law. The constitution guarantees religious
liberty, but this official Church nevertheless exercises considerable powers, and
frequently calls upon the civil authorities to give force to its decrees. The
Synod carefully watches over the observance of religious dogmas; it points out to
the authorities heretical or heterodox preachers and writers, and demands their
suppression; exercises a censorship over books and religious pictures; and calls
upon the civil tribunals to punish offenders.</p>

<p>There are no longer any Mo­ham­me­dans in Greece, except sailors or travellers,
and the last Turk has quitted Eubœa. The only Church besides
the established one which can boast a considerable number of adherents is
the Roman Catholic. It prevails amongst the middle classes on Naxos, and on
several others of the Cyclades, and is governed by two archbishops and four
bishops.</p>

<p>Greece is divided into thirteen nomes, or nomarchies, and these, again,
into fifty-nine eparchies. Each eparchy is subdivided into districts, or dimes
(dimarchies), and the latter into parishes, governed by paredres, or assistant
dimarchs. These officials are appointed by the King, and are in receipt of small
emoluments. The number of officials is proportionately greater in Greece than
in any other part of Europe. They form the sixtieth part, or, including their
families, the twelfth part of the population, and although their pay is small, they
swallow up between them more than half
the public income. <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span></p>

Balkan peninsula is, perhaps, that amongst the three great
peninsulas of Southern Europe which enjoys the greatest natural
advantages, and occupies the most favourable geographical position.
In its outline it is far less unwieldy than Spain, and even surpasses
Italy in variety of contour. Its coasts are washed by four seas; they
abound in gulfs, harbours, and peninsulas, and are fringed by numerous islands.
Several of its valleys and plains vie in fertility with the banks of the Guadalquivir
and the plains of Lombardy. The floras of two climes intermingle on its soil, and
add their charms to the landscape. The mountains of Turkey do not yield to those
of the two other peninsulas in graceful outline or grandeur, and most of them are
still covered with virgin forests. If they are less accessible than the Apennines of
Italy or the <i>sierras</i> of Spain, that is owing simply to the want of roads; for they
are, as a rule, of moderate elevation, and the plateaux from which they rise are
narrower and more extensively intersected by valleys than is the table-land of
Castile. Both Spain and Italy are closed in the north by mountain barriers
difficult to cross, whilst the Balkan peninsula joins the continental trunk by almost
imperceptible transitions, and nowhere is it separated from it by well-defined
natural boundaries. The Austrian Alps extend without a break into Bosnia, and
the Carpathians cross the Danube in order to effect a junction with the system of
the Balkan. To the east of the “Iron Gate” there are no mountains at all, and
Turkey is bounded there by the broad valley of the Danube. <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span></p>

<p>The proximity and parallelism of the coasts of two continents confer upon the
Balkan peninsula an advantage unrivalled, perhaps, throughout the world. It is
separated from Asia only by the narrow channel which joins the Black Sea to the
Ægean Sea: this channel is an ocean highway, and yet forms no serious obstacle
to the migration of nations from continent to continent. If the Black Sea were
larger than it is at present; if it still formed <i>one</i> sea with the Caspian, and extended
far into Asia, as it did in a past age, then Constantinople would necessarily become
the great centre of the ancient world. That proud position was actually held by
it a thousand years ago, and even if it should never recover it, its geographical
position alone insures to it an importance for all time to come. If the city were
to be razed to day, it would arise again to-morrow at some other spot in the neighbourhood.
In the dawn of history powerful Ilion kept watch at the entrance of
the Dardanelles: it survives in the city on the Bosphorus; and had there been no
Byzantium, its mantle would have descended upon some other town in the same
locality.</p>

<p>We know the part played by ancient Greece in the history of human culture.
Macedonia and Thracia, the two other countries bordering upon the Ægean, have
played their part too. It was those provinces which, after the invasion of the
Persians, gave birth to the movement of reaction which led the armies of Alexander
to the Euphrates and Indus. The power of the Romans survived there for a
thousand years after Rome itself had fallen, and the precious germs of civilisation,
which at a later period regenerated Western Europe, were nurtured there. It is
true, alas&#x202f;! that the Turk has put a stop to every enterprise of a civilising nature.
These conquerors of Turanian race were carried into the Balkan peninsula in the
course of a general migration of nations towards the west, which went on for
three thousand years, and was attended by perpetual broils. It is now five
hundred years since the Turks obtained a footing in the peninsula, and for more
than four hundred years they have been its masters, and during that long period
the old Roman empire of the East has been severed, as it were, from the rest of
Europe. The normal progress of these highly favoured countries has been interrupted
by incessant wars between Christians and Mo­ham­me­dans, by the decay of
the nations conquered or enslaved by the Turks, and by the heedless fatalism of the
masters of the country. But the time is approaching when that important portion
of Europe will resume the position due to it amongst the countries of the earth.</p>

<p>Vast tracts of the Balkan peninsula are hardly better known to us than the
wilds of Africa. Kanitz found rivers, hills, and mountains figuring upon our
maps which have no existence. Another traveller, Lejean, found that a pretended
low pass through the Balkans existed only in the imagination. Russian geodesists
engaged upon the measurement of an arc of a meridian found that Sofia, one of
the largest and best-known cities of Turkey, had been inserted upon the best maps
at a distance of nearly a day’s journey from its true position. The entire chain of
the Balkans had to be shifted considerably to the south, in consequence of explorations
carried on within the last few years. Men of science have hardly ventured
yet to explore the plateaux of Albania or Mount Pindus, and much
remains yet to <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
be done before our knowledge of the topography of the Balkan peninsula can be
called even moderately complete. The voyages and explorations of a host of
travellers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn24" id="fnanch24">24</a> have, however, made known to us its general features and its geological
formations. Their task was by no means an easy one, for the mountain masses and
mountain chains of the peninsula do not constitute a regular, well-defined system.
There is no central range, with spurs running out on both sides, and gradually
decreasing in height as they approach the plains. Nor is the centre of the peninsula
its most elevated portion, for the culminating summits are dispersed over the
country apparently without order. The mountain ranges run in all the directions
of the compass, and we can only say, in a general way, that those of Western Turkey
run parallel with the Adriatic and Ionian coasts, whilst those in the east meet the
coasts of the Black Sea and the Ægean at right angles. The relief of the soil and
the water-sheds make it appear almost as if Turkey turned her back upon continental
Europe. Its highest mountains, its most extensive table-lands, and its most
inaccessible forests lie towards the west and north-west, as if they were intended to
cut it off from the shores of the Adriatic and the plains of Hungary, whilst all its
rivers, whether they run to the north, east, or south, finally find their way into the
Black Sea or the Ægean, whose shores face those of Asia.</p>

<p>This irregularity in the distribution of the mountains has its analogue in the
distribution of the various races which inhabit the peninsula. The invaders or
peaceful colonists, whether they came across the straits from Asia Minor, or along
the valley of the Danube from Scythia, soon found themselves scattered in
numerous valleys, or stopped by amphitheatres having no outlet. They failed to
find their way in this labyrinth of mountains, and members of the most diverse races
settled down in proximity to each other, and frequently came into conflict. The
most numerous, the most warlike, or the most industrious races gradually extended
their power at the expense of their neighbours; and the latter, defeated in the
struggle for existence, have been scattered into innumerable fragments, between
which there is no longer any cohesion. Hungary has a homogeneous population,
if we compare it with that of Turkey; for in the latter country there are districts
where eight or ten different nationalities live side by side within a radius of a few
miles.</p>

<p>Time, however, has brought some order into this chaos, and commercial intercourse
has done much to assimilate these various races. Speaking broadly, Turkey
in Europe may now be said to be divided into four great ethnological zones. The
Greeks occupy Crete, the islands of the Archipelago, the shores of the Ægean Sea,
and the eastern slopes of Mounts Pindus and Olympus; the Albanians hold the
country between the Adriatic and Mount Pindus; the Slavs, including Servians,
Croats, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, and Tsernagorans (Montenegrins), occupy the
Illyrian Alps, towards the north-west; whilst the slopes of the Balkan, the
Despoto Dagh, and the plains of Eastern Turkey belong to the Bulgarians, who,
as far as language goes, are Slavs likewise. As to the Turks,
the lords of the land, <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
they are to be met with in most places, and particularly in the large towns and
fortresses; but the only portion of the country which they occupy to the exclusion
of other races is the north-eastern corner of the peninsula, bounded by the Balkans,
the Danube, and the Black Sea.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Crete,
next to Cyprus, is the largest island inhabited by Greeks. It is a natural
dependency of Greece, but treaties made without consulting the wishes of the people
have handed it over to the Turks. It is Greek in spite of this, not only because
the majority of its inhabitants consider it to be so, but also because of its soil, its
climate, and its geographical position. On all sides it is surrounded by deep seas,
except towards the north-west, where a submarine plateau joins it to Cythera and
the Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>There are few countries in the world more favoured by nature. Its climate is
mild, though sometimes too dry in summer; its soil fertile in spite of the waters
being swallowed up by the limestone rocks; its harbours spacious and well sheltered;
and its scenery exhibits both grandeur and quiet beauty. The position of Crete, at
the mouth of the Archipelago, between Europe, Asia, and Africa, seems to have
destined that island to become the great commercial emporium of that part of the
world. Aristotle already observed this, and, if tradition can be trusted, Crete
actually held that position for more than three thousand years. During that time
it “ruled the waves;” the Cyclades acknowledged the sway of Minos, its king;
Cretan colonists established themselves in Sicily; and Cretan vessels found their
way to every part of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. But the island unfortunately became
divided into innumerable small republics jealous of each other, and was therefore
unable to maintain this commercial supremacy in the face of Dorian and other
Greeks. At a subsequent period the Romans subjected the island, and it never
recovered its independence. Byzantines, Arabs, Venetians, and Turks have held
it in turn, and by each of them it has been laid waste and impoverished.</p>

<p>The elongated shape of the island, and the range of mountains which
runs through it from one extremity to the other, enable us to understand how
it was that at a time when most Greeks looked upon the walls of their cities
as synonymous with the limits of their fatherland, Crete became divided into
a multitude of small republics, and how every attempt at federation (“syncretism”)
miserably failed. The inhabitants, in fact, were more effectually separated
from each other than if they had inhabited a number of small islands forming
an archipelago. Most of the coast valleys are enclosed by high mountains,
the only easy access to them being from the sea, and communications between
the towns occupying their centres are possible only by crossing difficult mountain
paths easily defended. In all Crete there exists but one plain deserving the
name, viz. that of Messara, to the south of the central mass of mountains. It
is the granary of the island, and the Ieropotamo, or “holy river,” which traverses
it, has a little water even in the
middle of summer. <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span></p>

<p>The contour of Crete corresponds in a remarkable manner with the height
of its mountains. Where these are high, the island is broad; where they sink
down, it is narrow. In the centre of the island rises Mount Ida (Psiloriti), where
Jupiter was educated by the Corybantes, and where his tomb was shown. Its
lofty summit, covered with snow almost throughout the year, its gigantic
buttresses, and the verdant valleys at its base render it one of the most imposing
mountains in the world; but it was still more magnificent in the time of the
ancient Greeks, when forests covered its slopes, and justified its being called Mount
Ida, or “the wooded.” On the summit of this mountain the whole island lies
spread out beneath our feet; the horizon towards the north, from Mount Taygetus
to the shores of Asia, is dotted with islands and peninsulas; and in the south a
wide expanse of water extends beyond the barren and inhospitable island of Gaudo.</p>

<p>The Leuca-Ori, or “White Mountains,” in the western extremity of the island,
are thus called on account of the snow which covers their
summits, or because <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
of their white limestone cliffs. They are exceedingly steep, and perfectly bare,
hardly any verdure being met with even in the valleys at their foot. They are
known, also, as the Mountains of the Sphakiotes, the descendants of the ancient
Dorians, who have retired into their fastnesses, where they are protected by
nature against every attack. Some of their villages are accessible only by
following the stony bed of mountain torrents leaping down from the heights
in small cascades. During the rains the water rushes down these ravines in
mighty torrents. The “gates are closed” then, as it is said. One of these gates,
or <i>pharynghi</i>, is that of Hagio Rumeli, on the southern slope of the Leuca-Ori.
When rain threatens it is dangerous to enter these gorges, for the waters rush
down and carry everything before them. During the war of independence
the Turks vainly endeavoured to force this “gate” of the strong mountain citadel.
The level pieces of ground on these heights are sufficiently extensive to support
a considerable population, if it were not for the cold. The villages of Askyfo
occupy one of these plains, which is surrounded on all sides by an amphitheatre
of mountains. In former times this cavity was occupied by a lake. This is
proved by ancient beaches and by other evidence. But the waters of the lake
found an outlet through some katavothras (<i>khonos</i>, “sinks”) and discharged
themselves into the sea.</p>

<p>The remaining mountains of the island are less elevated and far less sterile
than the White Mountains. The most remarkable amongst them are the Lasithi,
and, still farther west, those of Dicte, or Sitia, a sort of pendant to the Mountains of
the Sphakiotes. Raised sea-beaches have been traced along their northern slopes,
covered with shells of living species, and they prove that that portion of the
island has been upheaved more than sixty feet during a recent geological epoch.
The northern coast, between the White Mountains and Mount Dicte, offers a
greater variety of contour than does the south coast. Its capes, or <i>acroteria</i>,
project far into the sea, and thence are gulfs, bays, and secure anchorages. For
these reasons most commercial cities have been built upon that side of the island,
which faces the Archipelago and presents a picture of life, whilst the south coast,
facing Africa, is comparatively deserted. All the modern cities on the northern
coasts have been built upon the sites of ancient ones. Megalokastron, better
known by its Italian name of Candia, is the Heracleum of the ancients, the
famous haven of Cnossus. Retimo, on the western front of Mount Ida, is easily
identified with the ancient Rithymna; whilst Khanea (Canea), whose white
houses are almost confounded with the arid slopes of the White Mountains,
represents the Cydonia of the Greeks, famous for its forests of quince-trees.
Canea is the actual capital, and although not the most populous, it is nevertheless
the most important and the busiest city of the island. It has a
second haven to the east, Azizirge, on Suda Bay, one of the best sheltered on the
island, and promises to become one of the principal maritime stations on the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn25" id="fnanch25">25</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span></p>

<p>Crete has certainly lost much in population and wealth, and the epithet of
the “isle of a hundred cities,” which it received from the ancient Greeks, no longer
applies to it. Miserable villages occupy the sites of the ancient cities, their
houses built from the materials of a single ruined wall, whilst immense quarries
had to be opened in order to supply the building materials required in former
times. The famous “labyrinth” is one of the most considerable of these ancient
quarries. Crete, in spite of its great fertility, exports merely a few agricultural
products, and nothing now reminds us of the fruitful island upon which Ceres
gave birth to Plutus. The peasants are the reputed owners of the land, but they
take little heed of its cultivation. Their olives yield only an inferior oil, and
though the wine they make is good in spite of them, it is no longer the Malvoisie
so highly prized by the Venetians. The cultivation of cotton, tobacco, and of
fruit of all sorts is neglected. The only progress in agriculture which can be
recorded during the present century consists in the introduction of orange-trees,
whose delicious fruit is highly appreciated throughout the East. M. Georges
Perrot has drawn attention to the singular fact that, with the exception of the
olive-trees and the vine, the cultivated trees of the island are confined to
particular localities. Thus chestnuts are met with only at the western extremity
of the island; vigorous oaks and cypresses are confined to the elevated valleys of
the Sphakiotes; the valonia oaks are met with only in the province of Retimo;
Mount Dicte alone supports stone-pines and carob-trees; and a promontory in
South-eastern Crete, jutting out towards Africa, is surmounted by a grove of
date-trees—the finest throughout the Archipelago.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Crete and the neighbouring islets are still Greek, in spite of
successive invasions, and they still speak a Greek dialect, recognised as a corrupted
Dorian. The Slavs, who invaded the island during the Middle Ages, have left
no trace except the names of a few villages. The Arabs and Venetians, too, have
been assimilated by the aboriginal Cretans; but there still
exist a considerable <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
number of Albanians, the descendants of soldiers, who have retained their
language and their customs. As to the Mo­ham­me­dans or pretended Turks, who
constitute about one-fifth of the total population, they are, for the most part, the
descendants of Cretans who embraced Islamism in order to escape persecution.
They are the only Hellenes throughout the East who have embraced, in a body,
the religion of their conquerors; but since religious persecution has subsided
several of those Mo­ham­me­dan Greeks have returned to the religion of their
ancestors. The Greeks of Crete are thus not only vastly in the majority, but
they hold the first place also in industry, commerce, and wealth; it is they who
buy up the land, and the Mo­ham­me­dan gradually retires before them. All
Cretans, with the exception of the Albanians, speak Greek, and only in the capital
and in a portion of Messara, where the Mo­ham­me­dans live in compact masses, has
the Turkish language made any progress.</p>

<p>We need not be surprised, therefore, if the Greeks lay claim to a country in
which their preponderance is so marked. But, in spite of their valour, they were
no match against the Turkish and Egyptian armies which were brought
against them.</p>

<p>The Cretans are said to resemble their ancestors in the eagerness with which
they do business, and in their disregard of truth. They may possibly be “Greeks
amongst Greeks—liars amongst liars;” but they certainly cannot be reproached
with being bad patriots. On the contrary, they have suffered much for the sake
of their fatherland, and during the war of independence their blood was shed in
torrents on many a battle-field. The vast cavern of Melidhoni, on the western
slope of Mount Ida, was the scene of one of the terrible events of this war.
In 1822 more than three hundred Hellenes, most of them women, children,
and old men, had sought refuge in this cavern. The Turks lit a fire at its
mouth, and the smoke, penetrating to its farthest extremity, suffocated the unfortunate
beings who had hoped to find shelter there.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The profound “Sea of Minos,” to the north of Crete, separates that island
from the Archipelago. All the islands of the latter have been assigned to the
kingdom of Greece—Astypalæa, vulgarly called Astropalæa or Stampalia, alone
excepted, which still belongs to the Turks. The ancients called this island the
“Table of the Gods,” although it is only a barren rock. It clearly belongs to
the eastern chain of the Cyclades, as far as geological formation and the
configuration of the sea-bottom go; but the diplomats allowed its fifteen hundred
inhabitants to remain under the dominion of Turkey.</p>

<p>Amongst the other islands inhabited by Greeks, but belonging to Turkey,
Thasos is that which lies nearest to the coast of Europe. The strait which
separates it from Macedonia is hardly four miles across, and in its centre there is
an island (Thasopulo), as well as several sand-banks, which interfere much with
navigation. Though a natural dependency of Macedonia, this island is governed
by a mudir of the Viceroy of Egypt, to whom the Porte made a present of it.
When Mohammed II. put an end to the Byzantine empire,
Thasos and the <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
neighbouring islands formed a principality, the property of the Italian family of the
Gateluzzi.</p>

<p>Thasos is one of those countries of the ancient world the
present condition of which contrasts most unfavourably with
former times. Thasos, an ancient Phœnician colony, was once
the rival, and subsequently the wealthy and powerful ally,
of Athens: its hundred thousand inhabitants worked the gold
and iron mines of <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
the island; they quarried its beautiful white marble; cultivated vineyards yielding
a famous wine; and extended their commercial expeditions to every part of the
Ægean Sea. But now there are neither mines nor quarries, the vines yield only
an inferior product, the agricultural produce hardly suffices for the six thousand
inhabitants of the island, and the ancient haven of Thasos is frequented only by
the tiniest of vessels. The island has recovered very slowly from the blow
inflicted upon it by Mohammed II., who carried nearly the whole of its inhabitants
to Constantinople. Thasos after this became a haunt of pirates, and its inhabitants
sought shelter within the mountains of the interior. They are Hellenes,
but their dialect is very much mixed with Turkish words. Unlike other Hellenes,
they are not anxious to improve their minds. They are degenerate Greeks, and
they know it. “We are sheep and beasts of burden,” they’ repeatedly told the
French traveller, Perrot.</p>

<p>Thasos, however, is the only island of the Archipelago where wooded mountains
and verdant landscapes survive. Rains are abundant, and its vegetation
luxuriant. Running streams of water murmur in every valley; large trees throw
their shade over the hill-sides; the villages near the foot of the mountain are
hidden by cypresses, walnut, and olive-trees; the valleys which radiate in all
directions from the centre of the island abound in planes, laurels, yoke-elms, and
vigorous oaks; and dark pine forests cover the higher slopes of the hills, the
glittering barren summits of Mount St. Elias and of other high mountains alone
rising above them.</p>

<p>Samothrace, though smaller than Thasos, is much more elevated. Its mountains
are composed of granite, schists, limestones, and trachyte, and form a sort
of pendant to Mount Athos, on the other side of the Ægean Sea. If we approach
Samothrace from the north or the south, it presents the appearance of a huge
coffin floating upon the waters; from the east or west its profile resembles a
pyramid rising from the waves. From its summit Neptune watched the fight
of the Greeks before Troy. In the dark oak forests of the Black Mountains
were carried on the mysteries of Cybele and her Corybantes, as well as the Cabiric
worship, which was intimately connected with them, and Samothrace was to the
ancient Greeks what Mount Athos is to the moderns—a sacred land. Numerous
ruins and inscriptions remain to bear witness to the zeal of devout travellers
from all parts of the world. But with the downfall of the heathen temples the
pilgrims disappeared. There is only one village on the island now. Its inhabitants
lead a secluded life, and the only strange faces they see are those of the
sponge-fishers who frequent the island during summer. The entire absence of
harbours, and the dangerous current which separates Samothrace from Imbro,
keep off the mariner, and though the valleys are extremely fertile, they have
not hitherto attracted a single immigrant from the neighbouring continent.</p>

<p>Imbro and Lemnos are separated from Samothrace by a deep sea, and appear
to continue the range of the Thracian Chersonesus. Imbro, which is nearest
to the continent, is the more elevated of the two islands, but its St. Elias does not
attain half the height of the mountains of Samothrace. There
are no forests <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
upon the slopes of this mountain, the valleys are covered with stones, and hardly
an eighth of the surface of the island is capable of cultivation. Still, the position
of Imbro, close to the mouth of the Dardanelles and upon an international ocean
highway, will always secure to it a certain degree of importance. The majority
of the inhabitants live in a small valley in the north-eastern portion of the
island, and though the rivulet which flows through this valley regularly dries
up in summer, it is nevertheless called emphatically the Megalos Potamos, or
“big river.”</p>

<p>Lemnos, or Limni, is the largest island of Thracia, and at the same time the
least elevated and the most barren. You may walk for hours there without
seeing a tree. Even olive-trees are not met with in the fields, and the village
gardens can boast but of few fruit trees. Timber has to be procured from Thasos
or the continent. Lemnos, in spite of all this, is exceedingly fertile; it produces
barley and other cereals in plenty, and the pastures amongst its hills sustain
40,000 sheep. The island consists of several distinct mountain groups of volcanic
origin, 1,200 to 1,500 feet in height, and separated by low plains covered with
scoriæ, or by gulfs penetrating far inland. In the time of the ancient Greeks
the volcanoes of Lemnos had not yet quenched their fires, for it was in one of
them that Vulcan, when hurled from heaven, established his smithy, and, with
the assistance of the Cyclops, forged his thunderbolts for Jupiter. About the
beginning of our era Mount Mosychlos and the promontory of Chryse were
swallowed up by the sea, and the vast shoals which extend from the eastern part
of the island in the direction of Imbro probably mark their site. Since the disappearance
of Mount Mosychlos, Lemnos has not again suffered from volcanic eruptions
or earthquakes. The majority of the inhabitants are Greeks, and the Turks
who have settled amongst them are being evicted by the conquered race, which is
superior to them in intelligence and industry. Commerce is entirely in the hands
of the Greeks. Its principal seat is at Kastro—the ancient Myrhina—which
occupies a headland between two roadsteads. Sealed earth is one of the articles
exported, and is found in the mountains. In ancient times it was much prized
as an astringent, and is so still throughout the East. It is not considered to possess
its healing qualities unless it has been collected before sunrise on Corpus Christi
day.</p>

<p>The small island of Stratio (Hagios Eustrathios) depends politically and
commercially upon Lemnos. It, too, is inhabited by Greeks. As to the islands
along the coast of Asia Minor, they form a portion of Turkey in Europe as
far as their political administration is concerned, but geographically they belong
to Asia.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn26" id="fnanch26">26</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">The
whole of the Ægean seaboard of European Turkey is occupied by Greeks,
and this proves the great influence which the sea has exercised upon the migrations
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean nations. Thessaly, Macedonia, Chalcis, and Thrace
are more or less Greek countries, and even Constantinople lies within Greece,
as defined by ethnological boundaries. The geographical distribution of race
there does not, in fact, coincide with the physical features of the country—its
mountains, rivers, and climate. The Turkey of the Greeks is, in reality, no
geographical unit, and the only tie which unites it are the waters of the Archipelago,
which wash all its shores.</p>

<p>Nowhere else does the Balkan peninsula exhibit such varied features as on the
shores of the Ægean Sea, and of the adjoining basin of the Sea of Marmara.
Bluffs, hills, and mountain masses rise abruptly from the plain; arms of the
sea extend far inland; and ramified peninsulas project into the deep waters of the
ocean. It appears almost as if nature were making an effort to create an archipelago
similar to that in the south.</p>

<p>The tongue of land upon which Constantinople has been built offers a
remarkable example of the features which characterize the coast lands of this
portion of Europe. Geologically the whole of this peninsula belongs to Asia.
Its hollow hills are separated from the granitic mountains of Europe by a wide
plain covered with recent formations, and the wall of Athanasius, now in ruins,
which was built as a defence to the city, approximately marks the true boundary
between Europe and Asia. The rocks on both sides of the Bosphorus belong
to the Devonian formation. They contain the same fossils, exhibit the same
outward aspects, and date from the same epoch. A patch of volcanic rocks at
the northern entrance to the Bosphorus likewise exhibits the same characteristics
on both sides of the strait, and there cannot be the least doubt that this European
peninsula at a former epoch constituted a portion of Asia Minor, but was severed
from it by an irruption of the waters.</p>

 HEIGHTS OF EYUB.</div></div><!--dctr-->

<p>Apollo himself, it is said, pointed out the site where to build the city
which is now known as Constantinople, and no better could have been found.
In fact, the city occupies the most favoured spot on the Bosphorus. It stands on
a peninsula of gently undulating hills, bounded by the Sea of Marmara and by
the curved inlet called, from its shape, its beauty, and the valuable cargoes
floating upon its waters, the “Golden Horn.” The swift current of the Bosphorus
penetrates into this inlet, and sweeps it clean of all the refuse of the city. It then
passes into the open sea at the extreme angle of the peninsula, and sailing vessels
are thus able to reach their anchorage without having to struggle against a
contrary current. This haven not only affords a secure anchorage to a multitude
of vessels, but it likewise abounds in fish; for, in spite of the constant agitation
of its waters by the oars of caiques and the paddles or screws of steamers, it
is visited annually by shoals of tunnies and other fish. The haven of Constantinople,
though easy of access to peaceable merchantmen, can readily be <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
closed in case of war. The surrounding heights command every approach to
it, and a chain has more than once been drawn across the narrow entrance to
its roadstead when the city was besieged. The latter, too, can be defended
easily, for it is built upon hills, bounded on the land side by an extensive
plain. An assailant, to insure success, must dispose not only of an army, but
also of a powerful navy. In addition to all these natural advantages of its
site, Constantinople is in the enjoyment of a climate far superior to that of
the cities of the Black Sea, for it is screened by hills from cold northerly
winds.</p>

<p>In the dawn of history, when migration and commerce marched only at a
slow pace, a site as favoured as that of Byzantium was capable only of attracting
the dwellers in its immediate neighbourhood. But after commerce had become
developed, the blind alone—so said the oracle of Apollo—could fail to appreciate
the great advantages held out by the Golden Horn. Indeed, Constantinople
lies not only on the ocean highway which connects the world of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
with the Black Sea, but also on the high-road which leads from Asia
into Europe. Geographically it may be described as occupying
a position at <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
the mouths of the Danube, Dniester, Dnieper, Don, Rion, and Kizil Irmak, whose
common outlet is the Bosphorus. When Constantine the Great constituted
it the metropolis of the Roman empire, it grew rapidly in population and wealth;
it soon became the city of cities; and its Turkish appellation, Stamboul, is
nothing but a corruption of the expression <i>es tam polin</i>, used by the inhabitants
to denote their going <i>into the city</i>. Amongst the distant tribes of Asia it represents
Rome. They know it by no other name than that of “Rum,” and the
country of which it is the capital they call “Rumelia.”</p>

<p>Constantinople is one of the most beautiful cities in the world: it is the
“paradisiacal city” of Eastern nations. It may compare with Naples or Rio de
Janeiro, and many travellers accord it the palm. As we approach the entrance
of the Golden Horn, seated in a caique more graceful than the gondolas of
Venice, the vast and varied panorama around us changes with every stroke
of the oars. Beyond the white walls of the Seraglio and its masses of verdure
rise here, am­phi­thea­tri­cal­ly on the seven hills of the peninsula, the houses of
Stamboul—its towers, the vast domes of its mosques, with their circlets of smaller
domes, and its elegant minarets, with their balconies. On the other side of the
haven, which is crossed by bridges of boats, there are more mosques and towers,
seen through a forest of masts and rigging, and covering the slope of a hill whose
summit is crowned by regularly built houses and the palatial residences of Pera.
On the north vast villa-cities extend along both shores of the Bosphorus.
Towards the east, on a promontory of Asia, there is still another city, cradled
amidst gardens and trees. This is Scutari, the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople,
with its pink houses and vast cemetery shaded by beautiful cypress groves.
Farther in the distance we perceive Kadi-koei, the ancient Chalcedon, and the
small town of Prinkipo, on one of the Princes’ Islands, whose yellow rocks and
verdant groves are reflected in the blue waters of the Sea of Marmara. The sheet
of water connecting these various portions of the huge city is alive with vessels
and boats, whose movements impart animation to the magnificent picture. The
prospect from the heights above the town is still more magnificent. The coasts of
Europe and Asia are beneath our feet, the eye can trace the sinuosities of the
Bosphorus, and far away in the distance looms the snow-capped pyramidal summit
of Mount Olympus, in Bithynia.</p>

<p>But this enchantment vanishes as soon as we penetrate into the streets of
Constantinople. There are many parts of the town with narrow and filthy streets,
which a stranger hesitates to enter. It is, perhaps, a blessing, from a sanitary
point of view, that conflagrations so frequently lay waste and scour large portions
of the city. Scarcely a night passes without the watchman on the tower of the
Seraskieriate giving the alarm of fire, and thousands of houses are devoured
by that element every year. The city thus renews itself by degrees. It rises
from its ashes purified by the flames. But formerly, before the Turks had built
their city of stone on the heights of Pera, the quarters destroyed by fire were
rebuilt as wretchedly as they were before. It is different now. The use of stone
has become more general; wooden structures are being replaced
by houses built <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
of a fossiliferous white limestone, which is quarried at the very gates of the city; and
free use is made of the blue and grey marbles of Marmara, and of the flesh-coloured
ones of the Gulf of Cyzica, in Asia Minor, in decorating the palaces of the great.</p>

<p>Nearly every vestige of the monuments of ancient Byzantium has been swept
away by fires or sieges. There only exists now the precious tripod of bronze, with
its three serpents, which the Platæans had placed in the temple of Delphi in
commemoration of their victory over the Persians. The relics of the epoch
of the Byzantine emperors are limited to columns, obelisks, arches of aqueducts,
the breached walls of the city, the remains of the palace of Justinian, only
discovered recently, and the two churches of Santa Sophia, which have been
converted into mosques. The grand church of Santa Sophia, close to the
Seraglio, is no longer the most magnificent edifice in the universe, as it was
in the time of Justinian, for even the neighbouring mosque of Sultan Ahmed
far exceeds it in beauty and elegance. It is a clumsy building, supported by
buttresses added at various times to keep it from falling. The character of the
interior has been changed by the Turks, who have introduced additional pillars,
and the once bright mosaics have been covered over; but the dome never fails to
strike the beholder: it is a marvel of strength and lightness.</p>

<p>The Seraglio, or Serai, near Garden Point, may boast of fine pavilions and shady
walks, but the dark memories of crime will always cling to it. The spot from
which sacks containing the bodies of living sultanas or odalisks were hurled into
the dark waters of the Bosphorus is still pointed out to the traveller. Far more
attractive than this ancient residence of the sultans are the marvellous structures
in the Arab or Persian style which line the shores of the Bosphorus, and which
impart to the suburbs of Constantinople an aspect of oriental splendour.</p>

<p>The bazaars are amongst the most curious places in the city, not so much
because of the rich merchandise which is displayed in them, but because they are
frequented by a variety of nations such as cannot be met with in any other city
of the world. The capital of the Ottoman empire is a centre of attraction not only
to the inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula, but also to those of Anatolia,
Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Tunis, and even of the oases. There are “Franks” from
every country of Europe, drawn thither by a desire to share in the profits of the
ever-increasing commerce of the Bosphorus. This mixture of races is rendered
still greater by the surreptitious importation of slaves; for, whatever diplomatists
may assert, there can be no doubt that the “honourable guild of slave-dealers”
still does an excellent business in negresses, Circassians, and white and black
eunuchs. Nor is anything else to be expected amongst a people who look upon
a well-stocked harem as a sign of respectability. Dr. Millingen estimates the
number of slaves at Constantinople at 30,000 souls, most of whom have been
imported from Africa. From an anthropological point of view it is certainly very
remarkable that the negro should not have taken root in Constantinople. In the
course of the last four centuries a million of negroes at least have been imported,
and yet, owing to difficulties of acclimation, ill-usage, and want, they would die
out but for fresh importations. <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span></p>

<p>Our statistics do not enable us to classify the 600,000 inhabitants of Constantinople
and its suburbs according to race.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn27" id="fnanch27">27</a> One of the principal sources of error
in estimates of this kind consists in our confounding Mussulmans with Turks. In
the provinces it is generally possible to avoid this error, for Bosnians, Bulgarians,
and Albanians recognise each other as members of the same race, whatever religious
differences may exist between them. But in the turmoil of a great city this
distinction is no longer made, and, in the end, all those who frequent the mosques
are lumped together as if they were members of the same race. Of the supposed
Osmanli of Constantinople a third, perhaps, consists of Turks, whilst the remaining
two-thirds are made up of Arnauts, Bulgarians, Asiatics, and Africans of various
races. Amongst the boatmen there are many Lesghians from the Caucasus. The
Mo­ham­me­dans, if not in the minority already, will be so very soon, for they lose
ground almost visibly. In old Stamboul, in which a Frank hardly dared to enter
some twenty years ago, they still enjoy a numerical preponderance, but in the
“agglomeration of cities” known as Constantinople, and extending from Prinkipo
to Therapia, they are outnumbered by Greeks, Armenians, and Franks, and
certain quarters of the town have been given up to the Christians altogether.</p>

<p>The Greeks are the most influential, and perhaps most numerous, element
amongst the rayas. Their head-quarters, like those of the Turks, are at Stamboul,
where they occupy a quarter of the town called Phanar, from an old lighthouse.
The Greek patriarch and the wealthiest Greek families reside there. These
Phanariotes, in former times, almost monopolized the government of the Christian
provinces of Turkey, but they fell into disfavour after the Greek war of liberation.
The religious influence, too, which they exercised until quite recently, has been
destroyed in consequence of the separation of the Servian, Rumanian, and
Bulgarian Churches from the orthodox Greek Church—a separation brought about
almost entirely through the rapacity of the Greek patriarch and his satellites.
If the Greeks would continue to preserve their pre-eminence amongst the races of
Constantinople, they must trust, in the future, to their superior intelligence, their
commercial habits, education, patriotism, and unanimity. To the Turks the
members of the orthodox Church are known as the “Roman nation,” and they
enjoy a certain amount of self-government, exercised through their bishops,
which extends to marriages, schools, hospitals, and a few other matters.</p>

<p>The “nation” of the Armenians is likewise very strong at Constantinople, and,
like that of the “Romans,” it governs itself through an elective Executive
Council. Much of the commerce of Constantinople passes through the hands of
Armenians, who, though they came to that city almost simultaneously with the
Turks, have down to the present day preserved their peculiar manners. They are
cold and reserved, and full of self-respect, differing widely from their rivals in
trade, the Jews, who slink furtively to their poor suburb of
Balata, at the upper <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span>
extremity of the Golden Horn. The Armenians are clannish in the extreme, they
readily assist each other, and, like the Parsees of Bombay, delight in acts of
munificence. But, unlike the Greeks, they are not sustained in their undertakings
by an ardent belief in the destinies of their race. Most of them are not even
able to speak their native language freely, and prefer to converse in Turkish or
Greek.</p>

<p>The Franks are much inferior in number to either of the races named, but
their influence is nevertheless far more decisive. It is through them that Constantinople
is attached to the civilisation of Western Europe, and their institutions are
by degrees getting the better of the fatalism of the East. It is they who built
the manufacturing suburbs to the west of Constantinople and near Scutari, and
who introduced railways. Every civilised nation of the world is represented
amongst them—Italians and French most numerously; and to the Americans is
due the credit of having established the first geological museum in Turkey,
in connection with Robert Colleg.</p>

<p>Constantinople, owing to the influx of strangers, is steadily increasing in population,
and one by one the villages in its vicinity are being swallowed up by the
city. The whole of the Golden Horn is surrounded by houses now, and they
extend far up the valleys of the Cydaris and Barbyzes, which fall into it.
Industrial establishments extend along the shores of the Sea of Marmara, from the
ancient fort of the Seven Towers far to the west, and from Chalcedon to the
south-east, in the direction of the Gulf of Nicomedia. Both banks of the
Bosphorus are lined with villas, palaces, kiosks, cafés, and hotels. This remarkable
channel extends for nineteen miles between the shores of Europe and of Asia.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn28" id="fnanch28">28</a>
Like a huge mountain valley it winds between steep promontories, now contracting
and then expanding, until it finally opens out into the vast expanse of the
Black Sea. When northern winds hurl the agitated waters of the latter against
the sombre cliffs which guard the entrance to the Bosphorus, the contrast between
this savage sea and the placid waters of the strait and its charming scenery is
striking indeed. At every turn we are arrested by unexpected charms. Rocks,
palaces, woods, vessels of every description, and the curious scaffoldings of
Bulgarian fishermen succeed each other in infinite variety.</p>

<p>Amongst the innumerable country residences which nestle on the shores of the
Bosphorus, those of Balta-Liman, Therapia, and Buyukdere are the best known,
for they have been the scenes of historical events; but there is no spot throughout
this marine valley which does not excite admiration. These marvels of nature
will, before long, have added to them a marvel of human ingenuity. The width
of the channel between the castles of Rumili and Anadoli is only 600 yards.
It was here Mandroclus of Samos constructed the bridge of boats across which
Darius marched his army of 700,000 men when he made war upon the Scythians,
and on this identical spot it is proposed now to construct a railway bridge which
will join the railways of Europe to those of Asia. A current runs through the
Bosphorus, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, at a rate of from two to six
miles an hour; and although several geographers conclude from this
that the level <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
of the former is higher than that of the latter, this must by no means be looked
upon as an established fact. We have already noticed the exchange between the
waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean and of the open Atlantic, which takes place through
the Strait of Gibraltar. A similar exchange is going on here, and the outflowing
surface current is compensated for by an inflowing under-current.</p>

<p>The outlying houses and villas of Constantinople extend northwards along the
Bosphorus as far as the two Genoese castles of Rumili-kavak and Anadoli-kavak.
This extension coincides with the geological features of the ground, for no sooner
have we turned our backs upon the houses than we find ourselves shut in between
cliffs of dolerite and porphyry, which extend as far as the Black Sea, where they
terminate in the precipices of the Cyaneæ, or Symplegades, the famous rocks which
opened and shut, crushing the vessels that ventured to pass through the strait,
until Minerva fixed them for ever. These volcanic rocks are barren, but the
Devonian strata to the south of them are beautifully wooded. The Turks, unlike
the Spaniards and other Southern nations, love and respect nature; plane-trees,
cypresses, and pines still shade the shores of the Bosphorus; and the vast forest of
Belgrade covers the hills to the east of Constantinople, from which the city draws
its supply of water. Birds, too, are better protected than in many a Christian
land. The plaintive cooing of doves is heard wherever we turn, flights of
swallows and aquatic birds skim over the surface of the Bosphorus, and now and
then we encounter a grave stork perched upon the top of a tree or of a minaret.</p>

<p>The whole aspect of the place is southerly, yet the climate of Constantinople
has its rigour. The cold winds of the steppes of Russia freely penetrate through
the strait, and the thermometer has been known to fall four degrees below zero in
the winter. The neighbouring sea renders the climate more equable than it would
otherwise be; but as the winds, from whatever direction they blow, meet with no
obstacle, sudden changes of temperature are frequent. The average temperature
varies very considerably in different years. Sometimes it sinks to the level of
that of Pekin or Baltimore, at others it is as high as that of Toulon or of Nice. In
exceptional cases the Bosphorus has become covered with ice, but thaws always set
in rapidly, and then may be witnessed the magnificent spectacle of masses of ice
striking against the walls of the Seraglio, and floating away across the Sea of
Marmara. In <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 762 these masses of ice were so stupendous that they became
wedged in the Dardanelles, and the tepid waters of the Ægean Sea then assumed
the aspect of a bay of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The geological features of the coast region of the Sea of Marmara differ
essentially from those of the rest of Turkey. Low ranges of hills rise close to the
coast, increasing in height towards the west, until they attain an elevation of
2,930 feet in the Tekir Dagh, or “holy mountains,” the grey slopes of which,
covered here and there with patches of shrubs or pasturage, are visible from afar.</p>

<p>A narrow neck of land joins the peninsula of
Gallipoli—the Thracian <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
Chersonesus of the ancients—to this coast range. This peninsula is composed of
quaternary rocks, which differ in no respect from those met with on the shore
of Asia opposite. Anciently a huge fresh-water lake covered a portion of Thracia
and more than half the area now occupied by the Ægean Sea. When the land
first emerged above the waters, the Chersonesus formed an integral portion of
Asia. Subsequently the waters of the Black Sea, which had forced themselves a
passage through the Bosphorus, likewise found their way through the Hellespont
into the Ægean Sea. The geological formation of the country and the configuration
of the sea-bottom prove this to have been the case, and this irruption of the
waters was attended, probably, by volcanic eruptions, traces of which still exist on
the islands of the Sea of Marmara and near the mouth of the Maritza, the former
to the east, the latter to the west of the peninsula.</p>

<p>If the statements of Pliny and Strabo may be relied upon, the Hellespont must
have been much narrower in former times than it is now. At Abydos—the
modern Naghara—the width is said to have amounted to seven stadia, or less than
a mile, anciently, whilst at the present time it is 6,500 feet. It was here Xerxes
constructed his double bridge of boats. The strait is deep at that spot, and its
current strong, but no wooden ship could hope to force a passage if covered by the
guns in the batteries on both coasts. The Hellespont, like the
Bosphorus, has two <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>
currents flowing through it. In winter, when the rivers which flow into the
Black Sea are frozen up, and the Sea of Marmara is no longer fed by the waters
of the Bosphorus, a highly saline under-current penetrates from the Ægean Sea
into the Dardanelles, whilst a feebler current of comparatively fresh water flows in
a contrary direction on the surface.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn29" id="fnanch29">29</a></p>

<p>Gallipoli, the Constantinople of the Hellespont, stands near the western
extremity of the Sea of Marmara. It is the first city which the Turks captured
upon the soil of Europe; but though they settled down there nearly a hundred
years earlier than they did at Constantinople, they are no more in the majority
here than they are in the capital. Gallipoli, like Rodosto and other towns on the
Sea of Marmara, is inhabited by Mo­ham­me­dans of various races, by Greeks,
Armenians, and Jews, forming separate communities dwelling within the walls of
the same town. The country population consists almost exclusively of Greeks,
who are the proprietors and cultivators of the land; and in sight of the coasts of
Asia, and within that portion of the Balkan peninsula which has been longest
under the rule of the Turk, the Greek is stronger numerically than anywhere else
to the north of Mount Pindus. He does not there confine himself to the coast,
and, if we except a few Bulgarian villages and the larger towns, the whole of
Eastern Thracia belongs to him.</p>

<p>The lowlands of this region form a vast triangular plain, bounded by the Tekir
Dagh and the coast range on the south, by offshoots from the Rhodope on the west,
and by the granitic mountains of Stranja on the east. This is one of the dreariest
districts of all Turkey. Swampy depressions and untilled land recall the steppes
of Russia; and in summer, when the wind raises clouds of dust, we can imagine
ourselves in the midst of a desert. The dreary monotony of this plain is relieved
only by the pale contours of distant mountains, and by innumerable artificial
mounds of unknown origin. So numerous are these tumuli that they form an
essential feature of the landscape, and no artist could convey a just idea of it
without introducing into his picture one or more of them.</p>

<p>Near the northern extremity of this unattractive plain, at the confluence of
Maritza and Tunja, lies the city of Adrianople, enveloped in trees, whose sight
delights the eye of the weary traveller. Adrianople, in reality, consists of a
number of villages, separated from each other by orchards, poplars, and cypresses,
above which peep out the minarets of some hundred and fifty mosques. The
sparkling waters of the Maritza and Tunja, of rivulets and of aqueducts, lend
animation to the picture, and render Adrianople one of the most delightful places.
But it is more than this. It is the great centre of population in the interior
of Turkey, and its favourable geographical position has always secured to the city
a certain amount of importance. The ancient city of Orestis, the capital of the
Kings of Thracia, stood on this site, and was succeeded by the Hadrianopolis of the
Romans, which the Turks changed into Edirneh, and made their capital until
Constantinople fell into their power. The old palace of the Sultan,
built in the <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
Persian style towards the close of the fourteenth century, still remains, though in
a dilapidated condition. But here, likewise, the Osmanli are in the minority.
The Greeks are their equals in numbers, and far surpass them in intelligence,
whilst the Bulgarians, too, muster strongly, and, as in other towns of the East, we
meet with a strange mixture of races, from Persian merchants down to gipsy
musicians. The Jews are proportionately more numerous in Adrianople than in
any other town of Turkey, and, strange to relate, they differ from their co-religionists
in every other part of the world by a lack of smartness in business
transactions. A local proverb says that “it requires <i>ten</i> Jews to hold their own
against <i>one</i> Greek;” and not Greeks alone, for Wallachians, and even Bulgarians,
are able to impose upon the poor Israelite at Adrianople.</p>

<p>The communications between Adrianople and Midea, the ancient Greek colony,
famous for its subterranean temples, and with other cities on the Black Sea, are
difficult. Its natural outlets are towards the south—on the one hand to Rodosto,
on the Sea of Marmara; on the other, down the Maritza valley to the Gulf of Saros.
The railway follows the latter, and the Rumelian Railway Company has constructed
an artificial harbour at Dede Aghach, enabling merchantmen to lie alongside
a pier. The allurements of commerce, however, have not hitherto induced the
inhabitants of Enos to exchange their walled and turreted acropolis for the marshy
tract on the Lower Maritza, with its deadly atmosphere.</p>

<p>The zone occupied by the Greeks grows narrower as we go west of the Maritza,
where the Rhodope Mountains form a kind of international barrier. Only the
coast is occupied there by Greek mariners and fishermen, whilst the hills in sight
of it are held almost exclusively by Turkish and Bulgarian peasants and herdsmen.
The marshy littoral districts, the small valleys on the southern slopes of the
mountains, and a few isolated hills of volcanic or crystalline formation constitute
a narrow band which connects the Greeks of Thracia with their compatriots of
Chalcidice and Thessaly. The Yuruks, or “Wanderers,” a Turkish tribe which
has retained its nomadic habits down to the present day, sometimes even extend
their excursions to the sea-coast. Their principal seat is in the Pilav Tepe, a
mountain mass to the north-west of Thasos, famous in the time of the Macedonian
kings for its mines of gold and silver. A wide plain extends immediately to the
west of these mountains, watered by the Strymon, or Karasu, and is of marvellous
fertility. Seres, a considerable city, occupies its centre, and hundreds of villages,
surrounded by orchards, rice, and cotton fields are scattered over it. Looked at
from the heights of the Rhodope, this plain assumes the appearance of a huge
garden-city. Unfortunately many parts of it are very insalubrious.</p>

<p>The triple peninsula of Chalcidice has no connection whatever with the
Rhodope, and is attached to the mainland by an isthmus covered with lakes,
swamps, and alluvial plains. It extends far into the sea like a huge hand spread
out upon the waters. Chalcidice is a Greece in miniature, with coasts of fantastic
contours, deep bays, bold promontories, and mountains rising in the midst of
plains, like islands in an archipelago. One of these mountain masses rises in the
trunk of the peninsula, and culminates in Mount Kortach, whilst each
of its three <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
ramifications possesses its own system of scarped hills. Greek in aspect, this
curious appendage to the continent is Greek, too, in its population; and, a rare
thing in Turkey, all its inhabitants are of the same race, if we except the Turks
in the town of Nisvoro and the Slav monks of Mount Athos.</p>

<p>The easternmost of the three tongues of land of Chalcidice, which jut out
far into the waters of the Ægean, is almost entirely detached. Only a low and
narrow neck of land connects it with the mainland, and it was across this
isthmus that Xerxes dug a canal, 3,950 feet in length, either to enable his fleet to
avoid the dangerous promontory of Mount Athos, or to give the awe-struck
inhabitants a proof of his power. This is the peninsula of Hagion Oros, the
Monte Santo of the Italians. At its extremity rises a limestone mountain, one of
the most beautiful in the Eastern Me­di­ter­ra­nean. This is the famous Mount
Athos, which an ancient sculptor proposed to convert into a statue of Alexander,
holding a city in one hand and a spring in the other, and which Eastern legends
point out as the “exceeding high mountain” to which the devil took Jesus, to
show him “all the kingdoms of the world.” But whatever old legends may say,
the panorama is not as vast as this, though the shores of Chalcidice, Macedonia,
and Thracia lie spread out beneath our feet, and the eye can range across the blue
waters of the Ægean Sea from Mount Olympus, in Thessaly, to Mount Ida, in
Asia Minor. The bold outlines of the fortified monasteries which appear here and
there, in the midst of chestnuts, oaks, or pines, on the slope of the mountain,
contrast most happily with the faint outline of the coasts on the distant horizon.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn30" id="fnanch30">30</a></p>

<p>This peninsula, which a traveller has compared to a sphinx
crouching upon the bosom of the sea, is the property of a
republic of monks, who govern <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
themselves according to their own fancy. In return for a tribute, which they pay to
the Porte, they alone have the right to live there, and strangers require their
permission before they are allowed to enter. A company of Christian soldiers is
stationed at the neck of the peninsula to prevent the sacred soil being desecrated
by the footsteps of a woman. Even the Turkish governor cannot gain admittance
without leaving his harem behind him. For fourteen hundred years, we are told
in the chronicles of Mount Athos, no female has set foot upon this sacred soil, and
this prohibition extends to animals as well as to human beings. Even the presence
of poultry would profane the monasteries, and the eggs eaten by the monks are
imported from Lemnos. With the exception of a few purveyors, who reside at
the village of Karyes, the 6,000 inhabitants of the peninsula are monks, or
their servants, and they live in the monasteries, or in the hermitages attached to
the 935 churches and chapels. Nearly all the monks are Greeks, but amongst
the twenty large monasteries there are two which were built by the ancient
sovereigns of Servia, and one which was founded by Russia. Most of these
edifices occupy promontories, and, with their high walls and strong towers, they are
exceedingly picturesque. One amongst them, that of Simopetra, appears to be
almost inaccessible. It is in these retreats the good fathers of the order of St.
Basil spend their lives in contemplative inaction. They are bound to pray eight
hours in the day and two in the night, and during the whole of that time they
are not allowed to sit. They have, therefore, neither time nor strength for study
or manual labour. The books in their libraries are incomprehensible mysteries
to them, and, in spite of their sobriety, they might die of starvation if there were
not lay-brothers to work for them, and numerous farms on the mainland which
are their property. A few shiploads of hazel nuts is all this fertile peninsula
produces.</p>

<p>The ancient cities of Olynthus and Potidæa, on the neck of the western
peninsula of Chalcidice, have dwindled down into insignificant villages; but the
city of Therma, called afterwards Thessalonica, and now known as Saloniki, still
exists, for its geographical position is most favourable, and after every siege and
every conflagration it again rose from its ashes. Vestiges of every epoch of
history may still be seen there: Cyclopean and Hellenic walls, triumphal arches,
and remains of Roman temples, Byzantine structures, and Venetian castles. Its
harbour is excellent, its roadstead well sheltered; and the high-roads into Upper
Macedonia and Epirus lead from it along the valleys of the Vardar and Inje
Karasu. These favourable circumstances have not been without their influence,
and Saloniki, next to Constantinople and Adrianople, is the most important city
of European Turkey. Its population is mixed, like that of other cities in the East,
and Jews are exceptionally numerous. Most of them are the descendants of
Spanish Jews, expelled by the Inquisition, and they still talk Spanish. Many
have outwardly embraced Mo­ham­me­danism to escape persecution, but the true
Mussulman spurns these converts with disdain. They are generally known as
“Mamins.”</p>

<p>The commerce of Saloniki is important even now, but
greater things are <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
expected of the future. Like Marseilles, Trieste, and Brindisi, Saloniki aspires to
become a connecting link in the trade between England and the East. It actually
lies on the most direct road between the Channel and the Suez Canal, and once
connected by railways with the rest of Europe, it is sure to take a large share
in the world’s commerce. This emporium of Macedonia is interesting, too, from
an ethnological point of view, for, with the exception of Burgaz, on the Black
Sea, it is the only place where the Bulgarians, the most numerous race of
European Turkey, have reached the sea-coast. Everywhere else they are cut off
from it by alien races, but Saloniki brings them into direct contact with the
remainder of Europe. Saloniki, however, not only suffers from bad government,
but also from the marshes which surround it, and in summer many of its inhabitants
flock to the healthier town of Kalameria, to the west. Miasmatic swamps
unfortunately occupy a large portion of the northern coast of the Ægean, and
they separate the interior of Macedonia more effectively from the coast than do its
mountains. There is hardly any commerce except at Saloniki.</p>

<p>On the western shores of the Gulf of Saloniki, beyond the ever-changing
mouths of the Vardar and the briny waters of the Inje Karasu, or Haliacmon, the
land gradually rises. Hills are succeeded by mountains,
until bold precipices <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
approach close to the coast, and summit rises beyond summit, up to the triple peak of
Mount Olympus. Amongst the many mountains which have borne this name, this
is the highest and the most beautiful, and the Greeks placed upon it the court of
Jupiter and the residence of the gods. It was in the plains of Thessaly, in the
shadow of this famous mountain, that the Greeks lived in the springtide of their
history, and their most cherished traditions attach themselves to this beautiful
country. The mountains which had sheltered the cradle of their race remained
to them for ever afterwards the seat of their protecting deities. But Jupiter,
Bacchus, and the other great gods of antiquity have disappeared now, and
monasteries have been built in the woods which witnessed the revels of the
Bacchantes.</p>

<p>Until recently the upper valleys of Mount Olympus were inhabited only by
monks, and by klephtes, or bandits, who sought shelter there from the Arnaut
soldiers sent in their pursuit. The mountain, in fact, constitutes a world apart,
surrounded on all sides by formidable declivities. Forty-two peaks form the
battlements of this mountain citadel, fifty-two springs rise within it, and the
bold klepht is secure within its fastnesses from the abhorred Turk. Magnificent
forests of laurel-trees, planes, and oaks cover its lower maritime slopes, and in
times of trouble they have served as a refuge to entire
populations. But Italian <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
speculators have purchased these forests, and the time is not, perhaps, very distant
when Mount Olympus, deprived of its verdure, will be reduced to a barren mass of
rock, like most of the mountains of the Archipelago. Wild cats abound on the
lower slopes of Olympus, chamois still climb its rugged pinnacles, but bears are no
longer met with: St. Denys, who dwelt upon the mountain, required beasts to ride
upon, and changed them into horses&#x202f;!</p>

<p>Xenagoras, an ancient geometrician, was the first to measure the height of
Mount Olympus, but his result, 6,200 feet, is far from the truth, for the highest
summit attains an elevation of 9,750 feet.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn31" id="fnanch31">31</a> It may possibly be the culminating
point of the Balkan peninsula. Snow remains in some of its crevices throughout
the year, and no human being hitherto appears to have succeeded in ascending its
highest pinnacle. According to the Greek legend, even Pelion heaped upon Ossa
did not enable the Titans to reach the abode of the gods, and, in reality, the
combined height of these two mountains hardly exceeds that of Olympus. But,
in spite of this inferior height, “pointed” Ossa and “long-stretched” Pelion,
known to us moderns as Kisovo and Zagora, impress the beholder, because of
their savage valleys, their precipitous walls of rock, and cliffy promontories.</p>

<p>These mountains continue southward through the hook-shaped peninsula of
Magnesia, and terminate opposite the island of Eubœa. They formed a strong
bulwark of defence in the time of ancient Greece. The hordes of the barbarians
stopped in front of this insurmountable barrier. They were compelled to seek a
practicable road to the west of it, through the valley of the Peneus, which is rightly
looked upon as the natural frontier of Hellas. Hence the great strategical importance
of Pharsalus, in Southern Thessaly, which protects the gorges of the Othrys
and the only access to the plains of the Sperchius. The pass of Petra, at the
northern extremity of Olympus, was carefully guarded for similar reasons.</p>

<p>A large portion of the area bounded by the crystalline rocks of Olympus and
Ossa, and by the cretaceous range of the Pindus, running parallel with the former,
consists of plains originally covered by vast lakes. The Gulf of Volo approaches close
to the shrunken remains of one of these lakes—that of Karla, or Bœbeis—into which
the waters of the swampy plain of Larissa discharge themselves. The dwellers on
the shores of this lake say that a dull rumbling noise may now and then be heard
at its bottom, which they ascribe to the bellowing of some invisible animal,
but which is more probably the gurgling sound of the water penetrating into a
sink-hole. Other lake basins are met with at the foot of Olympus towards the
west and north-west, and some of the valleys of the upper tributaries of the Peneus
are covered with alluvium left behind by the receding waters. Hercules, according
to some—Neptune, according to others—drained all these lakes of Thessaly into
the Ægean, by opening the narrow gorge between Olympus and Ossa, known to
the ancients as the Valley of Tempe. This narrow valley is due, no doubt, to the
slow erosive action of water. To the Hellenes it realised their ideals of refreshing
coolness and beauty, and once every nine years an embassy arrived from Delphi
to pluck the laurel-leaves destined for the victors in the
Pythian games. The <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span>
Valley of Tempe is indeed most beautiful; the transparent and rapid waters of the
Peneus, the foliage of the planes, the shrubberies of laurel-roses, and the red-hued
cliffs—these combine frequently, and form pictures which delight the senses and
impress the mind. But, taken as a whole, this narrow and sombre valley fairly
deserves its modern name of Lykostomo, or “wolf’s gorge.” Even in Thessaly,
and, above all, in the Pindus, there are localities more smiling and more beautiful
than this famous Valley of Tempe.</p>

<p>The upper valleys of the Peneus, or Salembria, abound in natural curiosities,
such as defiles, sinks, and caverns. To the north-west of Mount Olympus, the
turbid Titaresius flows through the narrow gorge of Saranta Poros, or of the
Four Fords, which was looked upon in former times as one of the gates of hell.</p>

<p>To the west, on the Upper Peneus, are the limestone hills of Khassia, rising
to a height of 5,000 feet, and the elevated spurs of Mount Pindus, which have
become celebrated through the “works of the gods,” or <i>theoktista</i>, which surmount
them. These “works” consist of isolated towers, crags, and pillars, the most famous
amongst them being those on the banks of the Peneus, not far from Trikala.
Zealous followers of Simeon the Stylite conceived the idea of building their
monasteries on the tops of some of the larger of these natural columns or pedestals.
Perched on these heights, and condemned never to leave them, they receive their
provisions and visitors in a basket attached to the end of a long rope, and hoisted
aloft by means of a windlass. An aërial voyage of no less than 220 feet has
to be performed in order to reach in this manner the monastery of Barlaam, and
visitors are at liberty to effect this ascent by means of ladders fastened against
the rocky precipices. The religious zeal, however, which led monks to select
these eyries for their habitations is gradually dying out. Out of twenty
monasteries which existed formerly, there remain now but seven, and only one of
these, that of Meteora, is inhabited by as many as twenty monks.</p>

<p>Of all the Greek countries which still remain under the dominion of the Turks,
there is none which has so frequently sought to regain its independence, none which
is claimed by the Hellenes with equal ardour as a portion of their common fatherland
and the cradle of their race. Thessaly is, in truth, a portion of Greece, as far
as the traditions of the past, a common language, and the general aspects of the
country can make it so. But it is a more fertile country, its vegetation is more
luxuriant, its landscapes are more smiling and delightful. We may not frequently
meet with the deep blue sky which calls forth our admiration in Southern Greece,
for the vapours rising from the Ægean Sea are attracted by Olympus and other
mountains; but this moisture imparts a charm to distant views, and, by protecting
the earth against the scorching rays of the sun in summer, it contributes largely
towards the fertility of the soil.</p>

<p>The Greek population of Thessaly is strongly mixed with foreign elements,
which it has gradually assimilated. Neither Serbs nor Bulgarians remain now in
the country, although the Upper Titaresius is known as Vurgari, or “river of the
Bulgarians.” The Zinzares, or Macedo-Walakhs, who were so numerous in the
Middle Ages, now only occupy a few villages. Though proud
of their Roman <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
descent, they gradually become Hellenized. Most of the words by which they
designate objects of civilised life are Greek, their priests and schoolmasters preach
or teach in Greek, and they themselves speak Greek in addition to their native
language. They lose ground, moreover, through an excessive emigration. Even
the cultivators of the soil amongst them have not quite given up their nomadic
habits, and the roving life of a herdsman or of a pedlar exercises an irresistible
attraction upon them. The Turks inhabit in compact masses the lowlands around
Larissa, and that town itself is Mussulman to a large extent. The hilly tracts to
the north, between the Inje Karasu and the Lakes of Kastoria and Ostrovo, are
likewise inhabited by Turks, who differ from the Osmanli of the rest of the
empire, and are known as Koniarides. Turks also occupy a portion of Mount
Ossa. It is easy to tell from a distance whether a village is inhabited by Turks
or by Greeks. M. Mézières has observed that “the Turks plant trees for the
sake of shade, the Greeks for the sake of profit.” Near the villages of the former
we find cypresses and plane-trees, near those of the latter orchards and vineyards.
The Koniarides are believed by some authors to have come to Thessaly and
Macedonia as colonists in the eleventh century, by invitation of the Eastern
emperor. They govern themselves through democratic representative bodies, and
are respected by all, because of their probity, their hospitality, and their rustic
virtues.</p>

<p>The Greeks are morally inferior to the Turkish peasantry, but they surpass
them in intelligence and industry. In the seventeenth century there took place
amongst them even a sort of revival similar to the Renaissance of Western Europe,
and the love of art was developed sufficiently far to give rise to a school of
painters in the villages of Olympus. Faithful to their national traditions and the
instincts of their race, the Greeks of Thessaly have sought to organize themselves
into self-governing commonwealths. In their free towns, or <i>kephalokhori</i>, they are
permitted to elect their town councils, establish schools, and appoint what teachers
they like. They know how to get the Turkish pasha not to meddle in their local
affairs. They pay the taxes demanded by the Turks, as their ancestors paid them
to Athens or some other Greek city, but in every other respect they are free
citizens governing themselves. The contrast between these independent commonwealths
and the <i>chifliks</i> of Mussulman proprietors cultivated by Greek farmers is
most striking. The land of the free proprietors is, as a rule, far less fertile than
that included within these chifliks; yet it produces more, and its cultivators live in
comparative ease.</p>

<p>The Greeks of Thessaly bestow much care upon the education of growing
generations. Even the most miserable Greek village in the Pindus can boast of
a school, which is visited by the young people up to the age of fifteen. As an
instance of the commercial spirit of the Thessalians we may mention the Weavers’
Co-operative Association, formed in the last century in the town of Ambelakia,
delightfully situated amongst orchards and vineyards on the southern slopes of the
Valley of Tempe. This powerful association wisely limited its dividends to six
per cent., and expended the surplus profits upon an extension of
its business. For <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
many years it enjoyed the greatest prosperity, but the wars of the empire, which
closed the markets of Germany against it, brought about its ruin. Co-operation
likewise partly accounts for the flourishing cloth manufacture of the twenty-four
wealthy Greek villages on the peninsula of Magnesia, to the north of the Gulf
of Volo. This district, together with that of Verria, to the north of the Inje
Karasu, is probably the most prosperous in all the Greek provinces of Turkey,
and it is at least partly indebted for this prosperity to its happy geographical
position, being far away from great strategical high-roads.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn32" id="fnanch32">32</a></p>

 <span class="smmaj">AND</span>

<p class="pfirst">The
name of <span class="smcap">S<b>HKIPERI,</b></span> which the Albanians give to the country they inhabit, is
supposed to mean “land of rocks,” and no designation could be more appropriate.
Stony mountains occupy the whole of the country, from the frontiers of Montenegro
to those of Greece. The only plain of any extent is that of Scutari
(Shkodra), to the south of the Montenegrin plateau, which forms the natural frontier
of Albania towards the north. The bottom of this depression is occupied by
the Lake of Scutari; and the Drin, the only river of the Balkan peninsula which is
navigable for a considerable distance from the sea, debouches upon it. The Drin
is formed by the junction of the White and the Black Drin, and in former times
it only discharged a portion of its waters temporarily into the Boyana River, which
drains the Lake of Scutari. But in 1858 it opened itself a new channel opposite to
the village of Miet, about twenty miles above its mouth, and since that time the
greater volume of its waters flows in the direction of Scutari, frequently inundating
the lower quarters of that town. The marshy tracts on the Lower Drin are
dangerous to cross during the heat of summer, and the fevers of the Boyana are
the most dreaded along the whole of that coast.</p>

<p>Most of the southern ramifications of the Bosnian Alps are inhabited by
Albanians, but they are separated from their kinsmen in Albania proper by the
deep valley of the Drin, a kind of <i>cañon</i> similar to those of the Rocky Mountains,
enclosed between precipitous walls several thousand feet in height, and hardly ever
trodden by the foot of a wanderer. The mountain systems of Bosnia and Albania
are only indirectly connected by a series of ranges and plateaux stretching from the
mountain of Glieb in a south-easterly direction as far as the Skhar, or Scardus of
the ancients. The crest of this latter runs at right angles to most of the ranges
of Western Turkey, and although its culminating point is inferior in height to
those of Slav Turkey, it is the point of junction
between the Balkan and the <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
mountain systems of Bosnia and Albania. The Skhar is of great importance,
too, in the hydrography of Turkey; for two great rivers, the Bulgarian Morava
and the Vardar, descend from its flanks, one flowing to the Danube, the other
to the Gulf of Saloniki. Chamois and wild goats are still met with in the
Skhar, as in the Pindus and Rhodope, and M. Wiet mentions an animal known
to the Mirdits as a <i>lucerbal</i>, which appears to be a species of leopard.</p>

<p>A mountain region, hardly 3,000 feet in elevation, but exceedingly difficult of
access, rises to the west of the Skhar, on the other side of the Black Drin: this
is the citadel of Upper Albania, the country of the Mirdits and Dukajins.
Enormous masses of serpentine have erupted there through the chalk, the valleys
are hemmed in by bold precipices, and the torrents rapidly run down the
hollowed-out beds on the exterior slopes. As a rule, the direction of the tortuous
ranges of this mountain country is the same as that of the southern spurs of
the Skhar. They gradually decrease in height, enclosing fine upland valleys,
where the waters are able to accumulate. The Lake of Okhrida, the largest sheet
of water in Upper Albania, has not inaptly been likened to the Lake of Geneva.
Its waters are bluer even than those of its Swiss rival, and more transparent, and
fish may be seen chasing each other at a depth of sixty feet beneath its surface:
hence its ancient Greek name of Lychnidos. The delightful little town of
Okhrida and Mount Pieria, with its old Roman castle, guard its shores, and the
white houses of numerous villages peep out amongst the chestnut forests which
cover the slopes of the surrounding hills. This lake is drained towards the
north through the narrow valley of the Black Drin. If the statements of the
inhabitants may be credited, the waters of the double basin of Lake Presba reach
Lake Okhrida through subterranean channels.</p>

<p>The isolated peak of Tomor commands this lake region on the west. To the
south of it commences the chain of the Pindus, locally known as Grammos. At
first of moderate height, and crossed by numerous mountain roads affording easy
communication between Albania and Macedonia, these mountains gradually
increase in height as we proceed south, and exactly to the east of Yanina they
form the mountain mass of Metzovo, with which the Pindus, properly so called,
takes its rise. This mountain mass is inferior in altitude to the peaks of Bosnia or
Northern Albania, but it is far more picturesque than either, its slopes being
covered with forests of conifers and beech-trees, and the plains extending along its
foot having a more southern aspect. Mount Zygos, or Lachmon, which rises in the
centre of this mountain mass, does not afford a very extended panorama, but if we
climb the craggy peaks of the Peristera-Vuna, or Smolika, near it, we are able to
look at the same time upon the waters of the Ægean and Ionian Seas, and even
the shore of Greece may be descried beyond the Gulf of Arta.</p>

<p>A famous lake occupies the bottom of the limestone basin at the western foot
of the mountain mass of Metzovo. This is the Lake of Yanina, and nowhere else
throughout Epirus do we meet with an equal number of natural curiosities as on
the shores of this lake. Its depth is inconsiderable, nowhere exceeding forty feet,
and it is fed only by numerous springs rising at the foot of the rocks.
There is no <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
visible outlet; but Colonel Leake assures us that each of the two basins into which
it is divided is drained by a subterranean channel. The northern lake pours its
waters into a sink, or <i>voinikova</i>, and reappears towards the south-west as a
considerable river, which flows into the Ionian Sea. This is the Thyamis of the
ancients, our modern Kalamas. Farther to the south the ancient Acheron bursts
from the rocks, and having received the nauseous waters of the equally famous
Cocytus, throws itself into the “bay of sweet waters,” thus called on account of
the large volume of water discharged into it by rivers.</p>

<p>When the waters of the southern and larger basin of Lake Yanina are low, there
is but a single effluent, which plunges down into an abyss, and in doing so turns
the wheels of a mill. The Cyclopean ruins of the Pelasgic city of Hellas command
this huge chasm with its roaring waters. The subterranean river reappears far to
the south, and flows into the Gulf of Arta. But when the level of the lake is high,
four other sinks swallow up its superabundant waters, and convey them into
the main channel, the direction of which is indicated by a few small lakes. The
important part played in the mythology of ancient Greece by these subterranean
effluents, and particularly by the infernal Acheron and the Cocytus, amply proves
the influence exercised by the Pelasgians upon the civilisation of the Hellenes.
The myths of the Hellopians became the common property of
all Greece, and <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
there was no temple in all Hellas more venerated than their sanctuary at Dodona,
where the future might be foretold by listening to the rustling of the leaves of
sacred oaks. This sacred grove existed, probably, near one of the Cyclopean
towns so numerous in the country, if not on the shore of the lake itself. Some,
erroneously no doubt, have looked for it near the castle inhabited in the beginning
of this century by Ali Tepeleni, the terrible Pasha of Epirus, who boasted of being
a “lighted torch, devouring man.”</p>

<p>The mountains of Suli, to the west of the basin of Yanina, attain an altitude
of 3,500 feet, but the neighbouring hills are of moderate height, though abrupt and
difficult of access, and near the coast they sink down into small rocky promontories,
scantily clothed with shrubs and overrun by jackals. Swamps abound near the
shore, and during summer their miasmatic air spreads over the neighbouring
villages. To the north of the swamps of Butrinto and of the channel of Corfu,
and to the west of the isolated peak of Kundusi, however, the coast rises again, and
the austere chain of the Chimæra Mala, or Acroceraunii, extends along it. It was
dreaded by the ancients on account of its tempests, and the torrents which poured
down its sides. Squalls and changes of wind are frequent near the “Tongue
(Linguetta) of Rocks,” the most advanced promontory of this coast, at the entrance
to the Adriatic Sea. These are the “infamous rocks” referred to by the Roman
poet, upon which many a vessel suffered shipwreck. The channel which separates
Turkey at that place from Italy has a width of only 45 miles; it is less than 100
fathoms in depth, and at some former period an isthmus may have united the two
countries.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn33" id="fnanch33">33</a></p>

<p>The Shkipetars, or Albanians, are subdivided into two leading tribes or nations,
the Tosks and the Gheges, both of whom are no doubt descended from the ancient
Pelasgians, but have in many places become mixed with Slavs, Bulgarians, and
Rumanians, and perhaps even with other nations; for whilst in some tribes we
meet with the purest Hellenic types, there are others the members of which are
repulsively ugly. The Gheges are the purest of their race, and they occupy,
under various tribal names, the whole of Northern Albania as far as the river
Shkumbi. The territory of the Tosks extends from that river southward. The
dialects of these two nations differ much, and it is not easy for an Acroceraunian
to understand a Mirdit or other Albanian from the north. Gheges and Tosks
detest each other. In the Turkish army they are kept separated for fear of their
coming to blows, and, when an insurrection has to be suppressed amongst them,
the Turkish Government always avails itself of these tribal jealousies, and is certain
of being served with the zeal and fury which hatred inspires.</p>

<div class="dcaptionsml">ALBANIANS.</div>
</div><!--dctr-->

<p>Up to the period of the migration of the barbarians, the whole of Western
Turkey, as far as the Danube, was held by Albanians. But they were then
pushed back, and Albania was entirely occupied by
Servians and Bulgarians. <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
The names of numerous localities throughout the country recall that period of
obscuration, during which the name of an indigenous race was not even mentioned
by the historian. But when the Osmanli had broken the power of the Serb, the
Albanians again raised their heads, and ever since they have kept encroaching
upon their Slav neighbours. In the north they have gradually descended into
the valley of the Bulgarian Morava, and one of their colonies has even penetrated
into independent Servia. Like the waters of a rising ocean, they overwhelm
the detached tracts of territory still occupied by Servians. This progress of the
Albanians is explained, to a great extent, by the voluntary expatriation of the
Servians. Thousands of them, headed by their patriarchs, fled to Hungary, in
order to escape the dominion of the Turks, and the Albanians occupied the wastes
they left behind. The Servians still hold their ground near Acroceraunia, on the
shores of Lake Okhrida, and in the hills looking down upon the fatal plain of
Kosovo, where their ancestors were massacred; but they gradually become
Albanians in language, religion, and customs. They speak of themselves as
Turks, as do the Arnauts, and apply the name of Servian only to the Christians
dwelling beyond the frontier. On the other hand, many of the customs
of the Gheges agree in a remarkable manner with those of their Slav neighbours,
and this proves that there has taken place a thorough blending of the two
races.</p>

<p>But whilst the Albanians are gaining ground in the north, they are losing it
in the south. A large portion of the inhabitants of Southern Albania, though
undoubtedly of Pelasgic origin, are Greek by language. Arta, Yanina, and Prevesa
are Hellenized towns, and only a few Mo­ham­me­dan families there still speak
Albanian. Nearly the whole of the tract between the Pindus and the Adriatic
coast ranges has become Greek as far as language goes, and throughout the
mountain region extending westward to the sea the inhabitants are “bilingual;”
that is to say, they speak two languages. The famous Suliotes, for instance, who
talk Tosk within the bosom of their family, make use of Greek in their intercourse
with strangers. Wherever the two races come into contact, it is always the
Albanian who takes the trouble to learn Greek.</p>

<p>This influence of the Hellenes is all the more powerful as it meets with
support amongst the Zinzares, known also as Macedo-Walakhs, “Limping”
Walakhs, or Southern Rumanians, who are met with throughout the country.
These Zinzares are the kinsmen of the Rumanians of Wallachia and Moldavia, and
live in a compact body only on the two slopes of the Pindus, to the south and east
of the Lake of Yanina. Like the Rumanians of the Danube, they are most
probably Latinised Dacians. They resemble the Walakhs in features, character,
and disposition, and speak a neo-Latin tongue much mixed with Greek. The
Zinzares in the valleys of the Pindus are, for the most part, herdsmen, and wander
away from their villages sometimes for months. Others carry on trades, exhibiting
much manual skill and intelligence. Nearly all the bricklayers of Turkey,
those of the large towns excepted, are Zinzares; and the same individual sometimes
erects an entire house, doing in turn the work of
architect, carpenter, joiner, <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
and locksmith. The Rumanians of the Pindus are likewise esteemed as clever
goldsmiths.</p>

<p>Their capacity for business is great, and the commerce of the interior of
Turkey is almost entirely in their hands, as is that of the maritime districts in
those of the Greeks. The Walakhs of Metzovo are said to have stood formerly
under the direct protection of the Porte, and every traveller, whether Mussulman
or Christian, was bound to unshoe his horses before he left their territory, for fear
“of his carrying away a clod of earth which did not belong to him.” Commercial
houses conducted by Walakhs of the Pindus are met with in every town of the
Orient, and even at Vienna one of the most influential banks has been founded by
one of them. Abroad they are generally taken for Greeks, and the wealthier
amongst them send their children to Athens to be educated. Surrounded by
Mussulmans, the Zinzares of the Pindus feel the necessity of attaching themselves
to some country through which they might obtain their freedom, and they hope
for a union with Greece. It is only quite recently that they have learnt to look
upon the Rumanians of the North and the Italians as their kinsmen. They do
not, however, set much store upon their nationality, and have no aspirations as
a distinct race. There can be no doubt that in the course of ages many of these
Macedo-Walakhs have become Hellenized. Nearly all Thessaly was inhabited
by Zinzares in the Middle Ages, and Byzantine authors speak of that country as
“Great Wallachia.” Whether these Zinzares have emigrated to Rumania, as
some think, or have become assimilated with the Greeks, the fact remains that at
the present day they are not very numerous on the eastern slopes of the Pindus.
Thousands of Rumanian families have settled in the coast towns, at Avlona, Berat,
and Tirana, embracing Mo­ham­me­danism, but still retaining their native idiom.</p>

<p>If we exclude these Zinzares, the Greeks of Epirus, the Servians, and the few
Osmanli dwelling in the large towns, there remain only the semi-barbarous Gheges
and Tosks, whose social condition has hardly undergone any change in the course
of three thousand years. In their manners and modes of thought these modern
Albanians are the true successors of the ancient Pelasgians, and many a scene that
a traveller may witness amongst them carries him back to the days of the Odyssey.
G. von Hahn, who has most thoroughly studied the Shkipetars, looks upon them
as veritable Dorians, whose ancestors, led by the Heraclidæ, burst forth from the
forests of Epirus to conquer the Peloponnesus. They are as courageous, as warlike,
as fond of dominion, and as clannish as were their ancestors. Their dress,
likewise, is nearly the same, and the white tunic (<i>fustanelle</i>) neatly fastened
round the waist fairly represents the ancient <i>chlamys</i>. The Gheges, like the
Dorians of old, are addicted to that mysterious passion which the historians of
antiquity have confounded, unfortunately, with a nameless vice, and which links
men to children by a pure and ideal love, in which the senses have no part.</p>

<p>There is no modern people respecting whom more astounding acts of bravery
are recorded than of the Albanians. In the fifteenth century they had their
Scanderbeg, who, though the theatre of his glory was more circumscribed than
that of his namesake of Macedonia, was hardly inferior to him
in genius, and <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
certainly surpassed him in justness and goodness of heart. Or what nation has
ever exceeded in courage the Suliote mountaineers, amongst whom not an aged
man, a woman, or a child was found to beg for mercy from Ali Pasha’s executioners?
The heroism of these Suliote women, who set fire to the ammunition waggons, and
then hand in hand precipitated themselves from the rocks, or sought death in the
mountain torrents, chanting their own funeral song, will at all times stand forth
in history as an astounding fact.</p>

<p>This valour, unfortunately, is associated amongst many tribes with a fearful
amount of savageness. Human life is held cheap amongst these warlike populations;
blood calls for blood, and victim for victim. They believe in vampires and
phantoms, and occasionally an old man has been burnt alive, on suspicion of his
being able to kill by the breath of his mouth. Slavery does not exist, but woman
is held in a state of servitude; she is looked upon as an inferior being, having no
rights or mind of her own. Custom raises a more formidable barrier between the
sexes than do walls and locked doors elsewhere. A young girl is not permitted to
speak to a young man; such an act is looked upon as a crime, which her father or
brother may feel called upon to punish by a deed of blood. The parents sometimes
consult the wishes of their son when about to marry him, but never those of their
daughter. The latter is frequently affianced in her cradle, and, when twelve years
of age, she is handed over to a young man on his presenting a wedding outfit and
a sum of money fixed by custom, and averaging twenty shillings. From that
moment he becomes the absolute master of his bride, though not without first
going through the farce of an abduction, as is customary amongst nearly all
ancient nations. The poor woman, thus sold like a slave, is bound to work for her
husband. She is his housekeeper as well as his labourer, and the national poets
compare her to the “ever-active shuttle,” whilst the father of the family is
likened to the “majestic ram marching at the head of the flock.” Yet woman,
scorned though she be, and brutalised by heavy work, may traverse the whole
country without fear of being insulted, and the life of an unfortunate who places
himself under her protection is held sacred.</p>

<p>Family ties are very powerful amongst the Albanians. The father retains the
rights of sovereign lord up to an advanced age, and as long as he lives the
earnings of his children and grandchildren are his own. Frequently this communism
continues after his death, the eldest son taking his place. The loss of a
member of the family, and particularly of a young man, gives rise to fearful
lamentations amongst the women, who frequently swoon away, and even lose their
senses. But the death of persons who have reached the natural limits of human
life is hardly mourned at all. The descendants of the same ancestor never lose
sight of their parentage. They form clans, called <i>phis</i> or <i>pharas</i>, which are
bound firmly together for purposes of defence or attack, or in the pursuit of their
common interests. Brotherhood by election is known amongst the Albanians, as
well as amongst the Servians and other ancient nations, and its ties are as strong
as those of blood. Young men desirous of becoming brothers bind themselves by
solemn vows in the presence of their families, and, having opened
a vein, they <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
drink each other’s blood. The need of these family bonds is felt so strongly in
Albania, that young people brought up together frequently remain united during
the remainder of their lives, forming a regular community, having its days of
meetings, its festivals, and a common purse.</p>

<p>But in spite of these family associations and clans, in spite of the enthusiastic
love which the Albanian bears his native land, there exists no political cohesion
amongst the various tribes. The physical conditions of the country, no less than
an unhappy passion for war, have scattered their forces, and rendered them
unable, consequently, to maintain their independence. The religious animosities
between Mussulman and Christian, Greek and Roman Catholic, have contributed
to the like result.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the majority of the Albanians are Mo­ham­me­dans.
When the Turks became masters of the country the most valiant amongst them
fled to Italy, and the greater part of the tribes that remained behind were compelled
to embrace Islamism. Many of the chiefs, moreover, turned Mussulmans, in order
that they might continue their life of brigandage, on pretence of carrying on a
holy war. This accounts for the fact of the aristocracy of the country being for
the most part Mo­ham­me­dan, and in possession of the land. The Christian peasant
who tills it is nominally a free man, but in reality he is at the mercy of his lord,
who keeps him at the point of starvation. These Albanian Mussulmans, however,
are fanatic warriors rather than religious zealots, and many of their ceremonies,
particularly those connected with their native land, differ in nothing from those
of their Christian compatriots. They have been converted, but not convinced, and
cynically they say of themselves that their “sword is wherever their faith is.”</p>

<p>In many districts the conversion has been nominal only, and zealous Christians
have continued to conduct their worship in secret. Many Mo­ham­me­dans of this
class returned to the faith of their fathers as soon as the tolerance of Government
permitted them to do so. As to the warlike mountain clans, the Mirdits, Suliotes,
and Acroceraunians, they had no need to bend to the will of the Turks, and
remained Greek or Roman Christians. The boundary between Gheges and Tosks
coincides approximately with the boundary between these two denominations,
the Roman Catholics living to the north of the Shkumbi, the orthodox Greeks to
the south of the river. The Hellenes and Zinzares in Southern Albania are
orthodox Greeks. The hatred between these two denominations of Christians is
intense, and this is the principal reason why the Albanians have not succeeded in
regaining their independence, as have the Servians.</p>

<p>Southern Albania and Epirus had feudal institutions up to the close of last
century. The chiefs of the clans and the semi-independent Turkish pashas lived
in strong castles perched upon the rocks, from which they descended from time
to time, followed by bands of servitors. War existed in permanence, and property
changed hands continuously, according to the fortunes of the sword. Ali the
Terrible, of Yanina, put a stop to this state of affairs. He reduced high and
low to the same level of servitude, and the central Government now wields the
power formerly exercised by lords and
heads of families. <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span></p>

<p>If we would become acquainted with a social condition recalling the Middle
Ages, we must go amongst the independent tribes of Northern Albania. On
crossing the Matis we at once perceive a change. Every one goes armed;
shepherds and labourers carry a carbine on the shoulder; and even women and
children place a pistol in their belts. Families, clans, and tribes have a military
organization, and at a moment’s notice are ready to take the field. A sheep
missing in a flock, an insult offered in the heat of passion, may lead to war. Not
long since the Montenegrin was the most frequent disturber of the peace, for, shut
up in his sterile mountains, he was often obliged to turn brigand in order to
sustain life, and laid under contribution the fields of his neighbours. The Turks
have at all times nourished this hatred between Albanians and Montenegrins.
They recompense the warlike services of the tribes of the border clans by
exempting them from taxation, and allowing them to govern themselves according
to their own laws. Let these immunities be touched, and they will make common
cause with their hereditary foes of the Black Mountains.</p>

<p>The Mirdits are typical of the independent tribes of Northern Albania. They
inhabit the high valleys to the south of the gorge of the Drin, and, though
hardly numbering 12,000 souls, they exercise, in consequence of their warlike
valour, a most important influence in all Western Turkey. Their country is
accessible only through three difficult defiles, and they hold command of the roads
which the Turkish troops must follow when operating against the Montenegrins.
The Sublime Porte, well aware how difficult it would be to subdue these redoubtable
mountaineers, has endeavoured to attach them, showering honours upon them,
and granting them the most complete self-government. The Mirdits, on their
side, though Christians, have at all times fought most valiantly in the ranks of the
Turkish army, in Greece and the Morea, as well as against their fellow-Christians
of Montenegro. They are formed into three “banners” of the mountains and
two of the plains, and in time of war are joined by the five banners of Lesh,
or Alessio. The banner of the renowned clan of Orosh takes precedence of all
others.</p>

<p>The country of the Mirdits is governed by an oligarchy, of which the Prince
or Pasha of Orosh is the hereditary head. His power, however, is merely
nominal, for in reality the country is governed by a council consisting of the
elders (<i>vecchiardi</i>) of the villages, the delegates of the banners, and the heads of
clans. The proceedings of this council are regulated by ancient traditions.
Wives are taken by force from the enemy, for the members of the five banners
look upon each other as relatives, and the Mo­ham­me­dan girls in the lowland
villages look forward with little fear to their being carried off by Mirdit warriors.
The <i>vendetta</i> is exercised in an inexorable manner, and blood cries for blood. A
violation of hospitality is punished with death. The adulteress is buried beneath
a heap of stones, and her nearest relative is bound to deliver the head of her
accomplice to the injured husband. It need hardly be said that education is at
a very low ebb amongst these savages. There are no schools, and in 1860 hardly
fifty Christians of the Mirdit country and of the district of Lesh
were able to <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
read. Agriculture, nevertheless, is in a relatively advanced state. The valleys of
the sterile mountains are cultivated with a certain amount of care, and they
produce finer crops than do the fertile plains, inhabited by an indolent population.</p>

<p>By a strange contrast, these direct descendants of the ancient Pelasgians, to
whom we are indebted for the beginning of civilisation in Europe, still number
amongst the most savage populations of our continent. But they, too, must yield
in time to the influence of their surroundings. Until recently the Epirotes and
southern Shkipetars left their country only in order to lead the easy but degrading
life of mercenaries. In the last century the young men of Acroceraunia sold
themselves to the King of Naples, to be embodied in his regiment of “Royal
Macedonians;” and even in our own days not only Mo­ham­me­dans, but also Christian
Tosks, enter the service of pashas and beys. These men, known as Arnauts, may
be met with in the most remote parts of the empire—in Armenia, at Bagdad, and
in Arabia. On the expiration of their term of service, the majority of these
veterans retire to estates granted them by Government, and this accounts for
the large number of Arnaut villages met with in all parts of the empire.</p>

<p>But wars are less frequent now, the life of a mercenary offers fewer advantages,
and increasing numbers of Albanians leave their country annually in order to gain
a living abroad by honest labour. Like the Swiss of the canton of Grisons, many
Shkipetars descend from their mountains at the commencement of winter in order
to work for wages in the plains. Most of these return to their mountain homes in
spring, enriched by their earnings; but there are others who remain abroad for
years, or who never return. The advantages of a division of labour appear to be well
understood by these mountaineers of Epirus and Southern Albania, and each mountain
valley is noted for the exercise of some special craft. One valley sends forth
butchers, another bakers, a third gardeners. A village near Argyrokastro supplies
Constantinople with most of its well-sinkers. The district of Zagori, perhaps the
home of the ancient Asclepiads, sends its doctors, or rather “bone-setters,” into
every town of Turkey. Many of these emigrants, when they become wealthy,
return to their native land, where they build themselves fine houses in the midst
of sterile mountains, and these take the places of the old seigneurial towers, which
were erected only for purposes of defence.</p>

<p>The Albanians are thus being carried along by a general movement of progress,
and if once they enter into the common life of Europe, we may expect them to play
a prominent part, for they possess a penetrating mind and much strength of
character. The Albanians enjoy the advantage of having ready access to the sea,
but hitherto they have derived only small benefit from it, not only owing to the
disturbed state of the country and the absence of roads, but also because of the
alluvial deposits formed by the rivers and the malaria of the marshes. Still,
making every allowance for these disadvantages, they hardly account for the
almost entire absence of maritime enterprise. One would scarcely fancy these
Epirotes and Gheges to be of the same race as those Hydriote corsairs who launched
whole fleets upon the waters of the Archipelago at the time of the war for Hellenic
independence, and who still maintain the foremost place
amongst the mariners of <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
Greece. The ports of Albania—Antivari, Porto Medua (one of the safest on the
Adriatic), Durazzo, Avlona, Parga (lost in a forest of citron-trees), and even strong
Prevesa, surrounded by more than a hundred thousand olive-trees—can boast but
of a trifling commerce, and two-thirds of that are carried on in Austrian vessels
from Trieste. With the exception of the Acroceraunians and the inhabitants of
Dulcigno, which is the port of Scutari, no Mo­ham­me­dan Albanian ventures upon
the sea, not even as a fisherman. In spite of the fertility of the soil, there are
hardly any articles to export. The mines of the country are unexplored, agriculture
is in a most backward state, and in Epirus hardly any industry is known
except the rearing of sheep and goats.</p>

<p>At the time of the Romans these countries were equally forsaken. There was
one magnificent city, Nicopolis, built by Augustus on a promontory to the north
of the modern Prevesa to commemorate his victory at Actium. The only other
town of importance was Dyrrhachium, called Durazzo by the Italians. It formed
the terminus of the Via Egnatia, which traversed the whole of the Balkan peninsula
from west to east, and constituted the great highway between Italy and the
Orient. Avlona may aspire one day to take the place of ancient Dyrrhachium.
Its geographical position is superior to that of Durazzo, for it is nearer to Italy,
and its deep and secure harbour enjoys the shelter of the island of Suseno and of
the Linguetta of Acroceraunia.</p>

<p>In the meantime all the commerce of the country is concentrated in Scutari
and Yanina, and in some other towns of the interior. The most considerable
amongst the latter are Prisrend, at the foot of the Skhar, whose nobles boast of
their magnificent dresses and fine weapons; Ipek (Pech), Prishtina, Jakovitza
(Yakova), in the north-eastern portion of the country, and on roads which lead
from Macedonia into Bosnia. Nearer the coast are Tirana, Berat, and Elbasan,
the ancient Albanon, whose name recalls that of the entire country. Gyorcha
(Koritza), to the south of the Lake of Okhrida, is likewise a place of much trade,
thanks to its position on a road joining the Adriatic to the Ægean Sea. Scutari
and Yanina occupy sites at the foot of the mountains, whose natural advantages
could not fail to attract a numerous population. Yanina, the capital of Epirus, is
the more picturesque of these two cities. It is situated on the shore of a fine
lake, opposite the somewhat heavy masses of the Pindus, but in sight of the
mountains of Greece, which are of a “luminous grey, glittering like a tissue of
silk.” At the time of Ali Pasha, Yanina became the capital of an empire, and its
population then exceeded that of Scutari. But the latter has now regained its
pre-eminence. It is admirably situated, and the roads from the Danube and the
Ægean, from the Lower Drin and the Adriatic, converge upon it. Scutari, or
Shkodra, is the first oriental city which a traveller coming from Italy meets
with, and the first impression made by its numerous gardens enclosed by high
walls, its deserted streets and irregular buildings, is sufficiently curious. Long
after he has entered the town, the traveller will remain uncertain as to its
whereabouts. But let him climb to the summit of the limestone rock surmounted
by the old Venetian castle of Rosapha, and the most
magnificent panorama will <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
unfold itself before his eyes. The domes of Scutari, its twenty minarets, the
emerald verdure of the plain, the surrounding amphitheatre of fantastically shaped
mountains, the winding waters of the Boyana and Drin, and the placid surface of
the lake glittering in the sun—these all combine to produce a spectacle of rare
magnificence. The sea alone is wanting to render this picture perfect, but, though
near, it is not within sight.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn34" id="fnanch34">34</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">Bosnia, in the north-western corner of Turkey, is the Switzerland of the
European Orient, but it is a Switzerland whose mountains do not reach the
zone of perennial snow and ice. In many respects the mountain ranges of Bosnia,
and of its southern province, the Herzegovina, resemble those of the Jura. They,
too, are composed principally of limestone, and rise in parallel ridges, surmounted
here and there by sharp crests. Like the successive ridges of the Jura, they are
of unequal height, and, taken as a whole, assume the appearance of a plateau
traversed by parallel furrows, and gently sloping in one direction. The most
elevated chain of Northern Bosnia is that which separates it from the coast of
Dalmatia, and the less elevated ridges running parallel with it gradually decrease
in height towards the north-east, in the direction of the plains of the Save.</p>

<p>Rocks not belonging to the Jurassic system, such as crystalline slates, dolomites,
tertiary deposits, and serpentine, are met with in various localities, and
impart some variety to the orographical features of Bosnia. Several crater-shaped
depressions in the east and south-east separate the mountains of Bosnia from the
mountain masses of Servia. The most remarkable amongst these plains is that
of Novibazar, into which numerous torrents discharge themselves, and which
commands roads diverging in various directions. This is the strategical key of
the country, and is destined on this account to become an important railway
junction.</p>

<p>Nearly all the mountain ranges which pass from Carniola and Austrian Croatia
into Bosnia increase in height as we advance towards the centre of the peninsula.
The bleached pyramid of the Durmitor, close to the northern frontier of
Montenegro, attains an elevation of nearly 8,000 feet, and the plateau surrounding
it is cut up by deep cavities, some of which, like the troughs of the Herzegovina,
open out in one direction, whilst others are completely shut in by declivities. The
Prokletya, or “cursed” mountain, still farther to the south-east, rises to a height
even more considerable, and constitutes one of the most formidable mountain
masses of all Turkey. A huge depression occupies its centre, the bottom of which
is covered by the Lake of Plava. Even in summer patches of snow may be seen
on some of the mountains which surround this
abyss. But Mount Kom, the <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span>
highest of all, never retains its cap of snow during the whole of the year, for it
melts away before the hot African winds to which it is exposed. Mount Kom
may possibly turn out to be the culminating point of the Balkan peninsula. It is
certainly one of the highest summits, and its double peak, rising above the plateau
of Montenegro, is descried from afar by the mariner navigating the Adriatic. It
has been ascended by several travellers, for its slopes are gentle.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn35" id="fnanch35">35</a></p>

<p>The rivers of Bosnia, like those of the Jura, flow between parallel mountain
ranges towards the north-east, along the furrows traced out for them by nature.
But these calcareous mountain ramparts of Bosnia, like those of the Jura, are
broken up by narrow gorges, or <i>cluses</i>, through which the pent up waters find
a way from furrow to furrow. Instead of taking a serpentine course, as do most
rivers flowing through a plain, these rivers of Bosnia change from valley to valley
by abrupt bends. Gentle and furious in turns, they gradually reach the lower
regions, and are finally swallowed up by the Save. Only one river, the Narenta,
finds its way into the Adriatic; all others, in accordance with the general slope of
the country, flow in the direction of the Danube. These river valleys, with their
sudden turnings, would be available as natural roads for reaching the plateau, if
most of the gorges were not exceedingly difficult of access; and until regular roads
have been constructed, as in the cluses of the Jura, travellers are obliged to scale
steep heights in order to pass from valley to valley. It is this want of practicable
roads which renders military operations in Bosnia so difficult and perilous.</p>

<p>Great armies have at all times remained to the east of the mountain masses
referred to, passing from the valley of the Vardar into that of the Morava, whose
springs almost intermingle their waters. In that locality we meet with the
bed of an ancient lake, through which flows the Sitnitza, one of the upper
tributaries of the Servian Morava: this is the plain of Kosovo, the “field of black
birds,” which reminds all southern Slavs of painful events. It was there the
power of the Servians succumbed in 1389, and, if we may credit ancient heroic
songs, more than 100,000 men perished in a single day. Five hundred years have
passed away since this great disaster, but the Slavs have never ceased to hope for
a day of vengeance, and they look forward to the time when on this very field
they may reconquer the independence they have lost.</p>

<p>The similarity between the mountains of Bosnia and of the Jura is rendered
complete by the existence of grottoes, sink-holes, and subterranean rivers. Sink-holes
from 60 to 100 feet in diameter, and shaped like funnels, are met with
in many localities. Several rivers appear suddenly at the foot of a hill, and,
after flowing on for a few miles, disappear again beneath some portal in the rocks.
The table-land of the Herzegovina especially abounds in phenomena of this kind.
The ground there is pierced by “sinks,” or <i>ponors</i>, which swallow up the water
derived from precipitation. “Blind valleys” and “troughs” present everywhere
the traces of currents of water and of temporary lakes, and after heavy rains the
subterranean basins sometimes rise to the surface, and a river then flows for
a time along the valley. As a rule, however, the
inhabitants are compelled to <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
collect the water they require in cisterns, or to fetch it from long distances.
Elsewhere the hydrography of the country is subject to annual changes. Lakes
which still figure upon our maps are drained through subterranean passages only
recently opened; other lakes are formed in consequence of some passage, which
formerly carried off the surface water, having become choked with alluvium.
No more curious river probably exists in the world than the Trebinishtitza, in the
Western Herzegovina. It appears and disappears many times. One of its branches,
flowing at one time on the surface, at others underground, crosses the plains of
Kotesi, in turns a parched champaign country or a lake abounding in fish, and
enters the Narenta. Other branches pass beneath the mountains, and gush out
near the shores of the Adriatic. One of the most famous of these springs is that
of Ombra, which pours its waters into the Bay of Gravosa, to the north of
Ragusa.</p>

<p>“Where the rocks finish and the trees appear, there begins Bosnia.” So said
the Dalmatians formerly. But many parts of Bosnia have now lost their clothing
of verdure. The table-lands of the Herzegovina and Montenegro, no less than
Dalmatia, have been despoiled of their forests, but Bosnia proper still remains a
country of woods. Nearly one-half its area is covered with forests. In the
valleys trees have almost disappeared, for the peasant is allowed to
wield his axe <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
without hindrance, but in the virgin forests of the mountains trees still abound.
The principal trees of Europe are met with in these magnificent woods: walnut-trees,
chestnut-trees, limes, maples, oaks, beeches, ash-trees, birches, pines, firs,
and larches. Austrian speculators, unfortunately, avail themselves of the roads
which begin to open up the interior of the country to devastate these forests,
which ought to be preserved with the greatest care. The song of birds is but
rarely heard in these sombre woods, but wild animals abound in them. They
shelter bears, wild boars, and deer, and the number of wolves is so large that their
skins form one of the most important articles of Bosnian commerce. Taken as a
whole, Bosnia ranks among the most fertile countries of Europe, and few regions
surpass it in the beauty of its rural scenery. In some parts of the country, and
particularly near the Save, large herds of hogs, almost wild, roam through the
oak forests. Hence the epithet of “country of hogs” which the Turks have
derisively given to Bosnia.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Jews, the gipsies, and the few Osmanli officials,
soldiers, and merchants in the principal towns, the entire population of the country
is of Slav race. The inhabitants of Kraina, near the Austrian frontier, call
themselves Croats, but they scarcely differ from the Bosnian Servians and
Raitzes of ancient Rascia, now known as the sandjak of Novibazar. On the
classical soil of Rascia originated most of those cherished <i>piesmas</i>, or popular
songs, in which the Southern Slavs have deposited their national traditions. The
Herzegovinians, in some respects, differ from their Bosnian kinsmen. They are
the descendants of immigrants who came from the banks of the Vistula in the
seventh century. Like their neighbours the Montenegrins, they are more voluble
in their speech than the Servians proper, and make use of numerous peculiar
turns of expression and a few words of Italian which have glided into their
language.</p>

<p>Although most of the Bosnians are of the same race, they are divided by
religious animosities, and these account for their state of political servitude. At
the first glance it may cause surprise that the Slavs of Bosnia should not have
succeeded in throwing off the Turkish yoke, like their kinsmen of Servia. Their
country is more remote from the capital, and far less accessible than Servia. A
conquering army coming from the south has not only to force numerous defiles,
but has to contend, too, with the climate, which is far more severe than that of
the remainder of the Balkan peninsula. But, in spite of these great natural
advantages from a defensive point of view, every revolt has hitherto failed
lamentably. We need not seek far for the cause of this: Christian and Mo­ham­me­dan
Bosnians are at enmity, and the Christians themselves are split up into
Greeks, who are led by their <i>popes</i>, and Romans, who follow blindly their
Franciscan priests. In their divided state they fall an easy prey to their
oppressors, and servitude has degraded their character.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans of Bosnia call themselves Turks, but they are Slavs nevertheless,
like their Christian compatriots, and, like them, speak Servian with a large
admixture of Turkish words. They are the descendants of the
nobles who, in <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, embraced Islamism in order to save their
feudal privileges. They also number amongst their ranks the descendants of
brigands, who changed their religion in order to be able to continue their trade
without fear of punishment. This apostacy gave to the lords even greater power
over their wretched dependants than they had formerly possessed. The hatred of
caste was augmented by religious animosity, and they soon surpassed in fanaticism
the Mo­ham­me­dan Turks, and reduced the Christian peasantry to a condition of
veritable slavery. A wild pear-tree is still pointed out near one of the gates of
Sarayevo, upon which the notables occasionally suspended some unfortunate raya
for their amusement. Whether beys or spahis, these Mo­ham­me­dan Bosnians are
the most retrograde element of old Turkey, and on several occasions, as in 1851,
they even rose up in rebellion in order to maintain intact their ancient feudal
privileges. Sarayevo, as a Mussulman city, stood under the special protection of
the Sultan’s mother, and possessed most extravagant privileges, which converted
it into a state in the state more hostile to Christianity than the Sublime Porte
itself.</p>

<p>Even in our own days the Bosnian Mussulmans possess far more than their
proper share of the land. The country is divided into <i>spahiliks</i>, or Mussulman fiefs,
which are transmitted, in accordance with the custom of the Slavs, indivisibly to
all the members of the family. The latter choose the most aged or most
valorous of their members as their head. The Christian peasants are compelled to
work for these Mussulman communities; and, although no longer serfs, they are
called upon to bear the chief burden of taxation and of other expenses. It is
natural, under these circumstances, that the Christians of Bosnia should shun
agriculture in order to devote themselves to trade, and nearly the whole of the
commerce is in the hands of the Christians of the Herzegovina and of their
co-religionists from Slavonian Austria. The Spanish Jews form communities in
the principal towns, where they carry on their usual commercial pursuits and
money-lending on tangible securities. They still talk Spanish amongst themselves,
and never mention without emotion the name of the country which sent them into
exile.</p>

<p>The number of Mussulmans hardly exceeds one-third of the total population of
Bosnia, and they are said to remain stationary, or even to diminish, whilst the
more fecund Christians increase in numbers.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn36" id="fnanch36">36</a></p>

<p>For the rest, the Bosnians, in spite of the differences in their religious belief,
possess the same natural gifts as their Servian kinsmen, and, whatever destinies
may be in store for them, they will in the end rise to the same level of intelligence.
They are frank and hospitable, brave in battle, industrious, thrifty, of a
poetical turn, fast as friends, and true as lovers. The marital
ties are respected, <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
and even the Mussulmans reject the polygamy permitted by the Koran. In the
Herzegovina the women enjoy much liberty, and in many villages there are even
back doors to the houses, in order that they may be able to gossip with their neighbours
without going into the street. In Northern Bosnia, however, the Mussulman
women are wrapped up closely in white linen sheets, and are hardly able to see
a few steps before them. But, in spite of these good qualities, there exists an
amount of barbarity, ignorance, superstition, and fanaticism, amongst Christians
and Mo­ham­me­dans alike, which is truly astounding. Incessant wars, tyranny on
the one side, and servitude on the other, have brutalised their manners. The want
of roads, the extensive forests, and the precipitous mountains have placed them
beyond the reach of civilising influences. There are hardly any schools, and the few
monasteries which supply their places are of little use, for the monks themselves
are steeped in ignorance, and their pupils at most learn to chant a few hymns.
Besides this, the immense consumption of <i>slibovitza</i> undermines the health of
the people and demoralises them, and it has been estimated that every Bosnian—man,
woman, or child—drinks annually no less than thirty-four pints of this
detestable plum-brandy.</p>

<p>It may be matter for surprise that bustling towns should exist in so rude a
country, but the natural resources of Bosnia are so great that a certain amount of
local trade was sure to spring up. Isolated as they are, the Bosnians are thrown
upon their own resources. They grind their own flour, manufacture their arms,
stuffs, and iron implements, and the exchange of these commodities has given
rise to commerce in the cities most favourably situated as entrepôts, the
principal amongst which are Sarayevo, or Bosna Serai, and Travnik, the ancient
capital of the country, picturesquely situated at the foot of an ancient castle.
Banyaluka, which is connected with Austria by a railway, has some trade with
Croatia; Tuzla extracts salt from its abundant brine springs; Zvornik, which
guards the frontier of Servia, also carries on some trade with that country; Novibazar
has commercial relations with Albania; Mostar and Trebinye import a few
articles from Dalmatia. The populations of these towns have not, however, been
solely attracted by trade and industry, for the insecurity of the country has also
contributed to that result. There is no part of Europe, the neighbouring Albania
and the polar regions of Scandinavia and Russia excepted, which is so rarely
visited by strangers, and this isolation will only cease when the proposed international
railway shall have joined it to Saloniki and Constantinople.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn37" id="fnanch37">37</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">The
centre plateau of Turkey is still amongst the least-known countries of
the Balkan peninsula, although it is intersected by the great highways which
connect Thracia with Bosnia, and Macedonia with the Danube.
This plateau, <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
known to the ancients as Upper Mœsia, consists of a vast granitic table-land, rising
to an average height of 2,000 feet. Its surface is diversified by several <i>planinas</i>,
or mountain chains, of small relative height, and by domes of trachyte, the
remains of ancient volcanoes. Its numerous depressions were formerly filled with
water, and the contours of the ancient lakes can still be traced. They have
been gradually filled up by alluvium, or drained by rivers. The most remarkable
amongst these ancient lacustrine basins are now represented by the fertile plains
of Nish, Sofia, and Ikhtiman.</p>

<p>The superb syenitic and porphyritic mountain group of Vitosh forms the
eastern bastion of the Mœsian plateau. Immediately to the east of it the deep
valley of the Isker pierces the whole of the Balkan Mountains, and, crossing the
plain of Sofia, takes its course in the direction of the Danube. The upper valley
of this river and the plain mentioned form the true geographical centre of
European Turkey. From Sofia diverge some of the most important roads of the
peninsula, one leading through the valley of the Isker to the Lower Danube, another
along the Morava valley into Servia, a third by way of the Maritza into Thracia,
and a fourth down the Struma into Macedonia. It is said that Constantine the
Great, struck by these important natural advantages of Sofia, then called Sardica,
thought of making it the capital of his empire. <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span></p>

<p>The Turks apply the name of Balkans to all the mountain ranges of the
peninsula, but geographers restrict that term to the Hæmus of the ancients. This
mountain rampart begins to the east of the basin of Sofia. It does not form a
regular chain, but rather an elevated terrace sloping down gently in the direction
of the Danube, whilst towards the south it presents an abrupt slope, it appearing
almost as if the plateau on that side had suddenly sunk to a lower level. The
Balkan consequently presents the appearance of a chain only when looked at
from the south. But its contours even there are only slightly undulating; there
are neither abrupt projections nor rocky pyramids, and the prevailing character is
that of long-stretched mountain ridges. The porphyritic mountain group of
Chatal, which rises to the south of the principal chain, constitutes the only
exception to this gentleness of contour. Though inferior in height to the summits
of the Balkan, its steep precipices, slashed crests, and chaotic rock masses strike
the beholder, and the contrast between this mass of erupted rock and the gentle
slopes of the calcareous hills which surround it is very great.</p>

<p>The uniformity of the northern slopes of the Balkan is such that, in many
places, a traveller is able to reach the crest without having come in sight of
mountains. When the woods have disappeared from the Balkan, these undulating
slopes will be deprived of their greatest charm; but, as long as the forests ornament
them as now, the country will remain one of the most delightful in Turkey. Running
streams flow through each valley, bordered by pastures as brilliantly green
as are those of the Alps; the villages are built in the shade of beech-trees and
oaks; and nature everywhere wears a smiling aspect. But the plains which extend
to the Danube are barren, and sometimes not a single tree is visible. The
inhabitants, deprived of wood, are dependent upon cow-dung dried in the sun
for their fuel, and they dig for themselves holes in the ground, where they seek
protection from the cold of winter.</p>

<p>The core of the Balkan, between the basin of Sofia and that of Slivno, consists of
granite, but the terraces which descend towards the Danube present every geological
formation, from the metamorphic to the most recent rocks. The cretaceous formation
occupies the largest area in Bulgaria, and the rivers rising in the mountains, in
traversing it, form picturesque valleys and defiles. Ancient fortresses defend each
of these valleys, and the towns have been built where they debouch upon the
plain. Tirnova, the ancient capital of the tsars of Bulgaria, is the most remarkable
of these old bulwarks of defence. The Yantra, on debouching there from the
mountains, winds about curiously; steep cliffs form an amphitheatre, in the centre
of which rise two precipitous isolated rocks, crowned formerly by walls and towers.
The houses of the town are built on the slopes, and its suburbs extend along the
foot of the cliffs.</p>

<p>A singular parallelism has been noticed on the northern slopes of Balkan. The
elevated mountain saddles, crests of secondary chains, geological formations, the
faults which give rise to the meandering of the rivers, and even the Danube itself,
all follow the same direction, from west to east. As a consequence, each of the
parallel valleys descending from the Balkans offers
similar features; the <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
population is distributed in the same manner; and the towns occupy analogous positions.
The valley of the Lom offers the only exception to the rule, for its direction is
towards the north-west. It debouches upon the Danube at Rustchuk, and its
green orchards and gardens are hemmed in by dazzling white cliffs of chalk rising
to a height of about 100 feet.</p>

<p>The symmetry would be almost complete in Northern Turkey if it were not
for the detached arid hills of the Dobruja, which force the Danube to make a wide
détour to the north. Rising in the low and swampy delta of the Danube, these hills
appear to be much higher than they are. In reality they do not exceed 1,650 feet
in height. It is possible that during some very remote geological epoch the
Danube took its course to the south of these hills, through the depression which
has been utilised for the construction of the first Turkish railway. Trajan, who
feared that the Goths might obtain a footing in this remote corner of the Roman
empire, constructed one of those lines of fortifications here which are known
throughout the countries of the Lower Danube as Trajan’s Walls. Remains of
walls, ditches, and forts may still be traced along the banks of the marshes, and on
the heights commanding them. This country of the Dobruja is the “savage
hyperborean region” where Ovid, exiled from Rome, wept for the splendours
of the capital. The port of Tomi, the place of his banishment, is the modern
Kustenje.</p>

<p>To the north of the Gulf of Burgas, which is the westernmost extremity of the
Black Sea, rise the fine porphyry mountains which terminate in the superb Cape of
Emineh. They are sometimes described as an eastern prolongation of the Balkan,
but erroneously, for the ancient lacustrine basin of Karnabat, now traversed by a
railway, separates them from the system of the Hæmus. The granitic plateaux and
mountains of Tunja and Stranja, which command the wide plain of Thracia on the
north, are likewise separate mountain ranges. The Southern Balkan is, in reality,
without ramifications or spurs, except in the west, where the mountains of
Ikhtiman and of Samakov, so rich in iron ore and thermal springs, and other
transverse chains, connect it with the mountain mass of the Rhodope. The upper
basin of the Maritza River, enclosed between the Balkan and the Rhodope, has the
shape of an elongated triangle, whose apex, directed towards the plain of Sofia,
indicates the point of junction between the two systems. The whole of this
triangular depression, with its lateral ramifications, was formerly occupied by
lakes, now converted into bottom-lands of marvellous fertility. The passes near
the apex of this triangle are naturally points of the highest strategical and commercial
importance. Through one of them, still marked by ancient fortifications,
and known as Trajan’s Gate, passed the old Roman highway, and there, too, the
railway now in course of construction will cross the summit between the two slopes
of the peninsula. This is the true “gateway of Constantinople,” and from
the most remote times nations have fought for its possession. The numerous
tumuli scattered over the neighbouring plains bear witness to many a bloody
struggle.</p>

<p>The spurs of the Rhodope intermingle with those of the Balkan,
and the lowest <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
pass which separates the two still exceeds 3,000 feet in elevation. The Rilo Dagh,
the most elevated mountain mass of the Rhodope, boldly rises at its northern
extremity, and, to use the expression of Barth, forms the shoulder-blade of junction.
Its height is 9,580 feet. It rises far beyond the region of forests, and its
jagged summits, pyramids, and platforms contrast strikingly with the rounded
outlines of the Balkan. But the lower heights, surrounded by this imposing
amphitheatre of grand summits, are covered with vegetation. Forests of pines,
larches, and beech-trees, the haunts of bears and chamois, alternate with clumps of
trees and cultivated fields, and the villages in the valleys are surrounded by
meadows, vineyards, and oaks. Picturesque cupolas of numerous monasteries
peep out amongst the verdure: to their existence the mountain owes its Turkish
name of Despoto Dagh, <i>i.e.</i> “mountain of the parsons.” The Rilo Dagh, likewise
famous on account of its monasteries, has altogether the aspect of the Swiss Alps.
The moist winds of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean convey to it much snow in winter and
spring, but in summer the clouds discharge only torrents of rain, and the snow
rapidly disappears from the flanks of the mountains. These sudden rain-storms
are amongst the most remarkable spectacles to be witnessed. In the forenoon the
mist which hides the tops of the mountains grows dense by degrees, and heavy
copper-coloured clouds collect on the slopes. About three in the afternoon the
rain begins to pour down, the clouds grow visibly smaller, first one, then another
summit is seen through a rent in the watery vapours, until at last the air has
become purified, and the mountains are lit up in the sunset.</p>

<p>To the south of the Rilo Dagh rises the mountain mass of Perim, hardly
inferior to it in height. This is the Orbelos of the ancient Greeks, and the rings
to which Noah made fast his ark when the waters subsided after the deluge are
still shown there, and even Mussulman pilgrims pay their devotions at this
venerated spot. It is the last high summit of the Rhodope. The mountains to
the south rapidly decrease in elevation, though the granitic formation to which
they belong is spread over a vast extent of country from the plains of Thracia to
Albania. The extent of the hilly region connected with the Rhodope is still
further increased by numerous groups of extinct volcanoes, which have poured
forth vast sheets of trachytic lava. The rivers which flow from the central plateau
of Turkey into the Ægean Sea have cut for themselves deep passages through these
granites and lavas, the most famous amongst which is the “Iron Gate” of the
Vardar, or Demir Kapu, which formerly figured on our maps of Turkey as a large
town.</p>

<p>The aspect of the crystalline mountain masses to the west of the Vardar is
altogether of an Alpine character, for the peaks not only attain a high elevation,
but snow remains upon them during the greater portion of the year. The
Gornichova, or Nije, to the north of Thessaly, rises to a height of 6,560 feet; and
the Peristeri, whose triple summit and snow-clad shoulders have been likened to
the spread-out wings of a bird, and which rises close to the city of Bitolia, or
Monastir, is more elevated still. The mountains of ancient Dardania enclose
extensive circular or elliptical plains, and the most
remarkable amongst these, <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
namely, that of Monastir, has been compared by Grisebach, the geologist, to one of
those huge crater lakes which the telescope has revealed to us on the surface
of the moon. In most of these plains we meet with swamps or small lakes,
the only remains of the sheets of water which at one time covered them.
The most extensive of these lakes is that of Ostrovo. The Lake of Kastoria
resembles the filled-up crater of a volcano. In its centre rises a limestone
hill joined to the shore by an isthmus, upon which is built a picturesque Greek
town.</p>

<p>According to Viquesnel and Hochstetter, traces of glaciers do not exist in
any of these ancient lacustrine basins, or on the flanks of the mountains. It is
certainly remarkable that whilst other European mountains—as, for instance, the
Vosges and the mountains of Auvergne—have passed through a glacial epoch, the
far more elevated Peristeri, Rilo Dagh, and Balkan, under about the same latitude
as the Pyrenees, should never have had their valleys filled by moving rivers
of ice.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn38" id="fnanch38">38</a></p>

<p>All the large rivers of European Turkey belong to the Bulgarian regions of
the Balkan or Hæmus. In Bosnia there are merely small parallel rivers flowing to
the Save; Albania has only turbulent torrents forcing their way through wild
gorges, like the Drin; but the Maritza, the Strymon or Karasu, the Vardar, and
the Inje Karasu, which descend from the southern flanks of the Balkans, or
originate in the crystalline mountain masses of the Rhodope, are large rivers,
which bear comparison with the tranquil streams of Western Europe. As yet we
know but little about their mode of action. The volume of water discharged by
them has never been measured, and they are hardly made use of for purposes of
navigation or irrigation. They all traverse ancient lake basins, which they have
filled up gradually with alluvium, and converted into fertile plains. This work of
filling up still goes on in the lower portions of these fluvial valleys, where
extensive marshes, and even gradually shrinking lakes, abound. One of these
lakes, the Takhino, through which the Strymon flows before it enters the Ægean
Sea, is said to be the Prasias of Herodotus, and its aquatic villages were no doubt
similar to the pile dwellings discovered in nearly all the lakes of Central
Europe.</p>

<p>The Danube, to the north of the Dobruja, performs an amount of geological
work, in comparison with which that of the Maritza, the Strymon, and Vardar
sinks into insignificance. That mighty river annually conveys to the Black Sea
a volume of water far in excess of that which is carried down the rivers of all
France, and the solids which it holds in suspension are sufficient to cover an area
of ten square miles to a depth of nine feet. This enormous mass of sand and clay
is annually deposited in the swamps and on the banks of the delta, and the slow
but steady growth of the latter is thus sufficiently explained.
Even the ancients <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
anticipated a time when the Black Sea would be converted into a shallow pond
abounding in sand-banks, and it must, therefore, afford some consolation to our
mariners to be told that six million years must pass before the alluvium carried
down the river will fill the whole of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The large triangular plain which the Danube has conquered from the sea has
not yet fully emerged from the waters. Lakes, and the remains of ancient bays,
half-obliterated branches of the Danube, and the ever-changing beds of rivulets,
have converted this delta into a domain, half land, half sea. More elevated tracts,
consolidated by the attack of the waves, rise here and there above the melancholy
mire and reeds, and bear a dense vegetation of oaks, olives, and beeches. Willows
fringe most of the branches of the river which take their winding course through
the delta. Twenty years ago the Danube had six mouths; it has now only
three.</p>

<p>After the Crimean war the Western powers determined that the Kilia branch,
which conveys to the Black Sea more than half the volume of the Danube, should
thenceforth form the boundary between Rumania and Turkey. The Sultan thus
possesses not only the whole of the delta, which has an area of about 4,000 square
miles, but also the only mouth of the river which makes the possession of that
territory of any value to him. The mouth of the Kilia is closed by a bar of sand,
which does not even permit small vessels
to enter it. <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span></p>

<p>The southern mouth, that of Khidrillis, or St. George, is likewise inaccessible.
The centre branch, that of the Sulina, which has served the purposes of commerce
from time immemorial, can alone be entered by vessels. But even this channel
would not be practicable, in the case of large vessels, if our engineers had
not improved its facilities of access. Formerly the depth of water on the bar
hardly exceeded a fathom during April, June, and July; and even at times of
flood was at most two or three fathoms. But by building convergent jetties,
which guide the waters of the river into the deep sea, the depth of water has
been increased to the extent of ten feet, and vessels drawing twenty feet can
enter. Sulina is now one of the most important commercial ports of Europe, and
a highly prized harbour of refuge on the Black Sea, which is so much dreaded by
mariners on account of its squalls. We are indebted for this great public work
to an international commission, which enjoys almost sovereign rights over the
Danube as high up as Isakcha.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn39" id="fnanch39">39</a></p>

<p>The Bulgarians inhabit the country to the south of the Danube as far as the
slopes of Mount Pindus, excepting only certain detached territories in the occupation
of Turks, Wallachians, Zinzares, or Greeks. In the Middle Ages their
kingdom was even more extensive, for it included the whole of Albania, and had
Okhrida for its capital.</p>

<p>The origin of the Bulgarians has been a theme of frequent discussion. The
Bulgarians of the Byzantines, who laid waste the plains of Thracia about the
close of the fifth century, and whose name became a term of opprobrium, probably
were a Ugrian race, like the Huns, and spoke a language akin to that of the
Samoyeds. The name of these savage conquerors is sometimes derived from the
Volga, on the banks of which they formerly dwelt; but their manners and
appearance have undergone a singular change, and nothing now indicates their
origin. Originally Turanians, they have been converted into Slavs, like their
neighbours the Servians and Russians.</p>

<p>This rapid conversion of the Bulgarians into Slavs is one of the most remarkable
ethnological phenomena of the Middle Ages. Even in the ninth century the
Bulgarians had adopted the Servian language, and soon afterwards they ceased
to speak their own. Their idiom is less polished than that of the Servians, and,
possessing no literature, has not become fixed. The purest Bulgarian, it is said,
may be heard in the district of Kalofer, to the south of the Balkan. The gradual
transformation of the Bulgarians into Slavs is
ascribed by some authors to the <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
prodigious facility for imitation possessed by that people; but it is simpler to
assume that, in course of time, the conquering Bulgarians and the conquered
Servians became amalgamated, and that, whilst the former gave a name to the
new nation, the latter contributed their language, their manners, and physical
features. Thus much is certain, that the inhabitants of Bulgaria must now be
looked upon as members of the Slavonian family of nations. Together with the
Servians, Croats, and Herzegovinians, they are the most numerous people of
European Turkey; and, if the succession to the dominion of the Turks is to be
decided by numbers alone, it belongs to the Servo-Bulgarians, and not to the
Greeks.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, as a rule, are not so tall as their neighbours the Servians;
they are squat, strongly built, with a large head on broad shoulders. Lejean,
himself a Breton, and others, consider that they bear a striking resemblance to
the peasants of Brittany. In several districts, and notably in the environs of
Philippopoli, they shave the head, a tuft of hair alone excepted, which they
cultivate and dress into a tail as carefully as the Chinese. Greeks and Wallachians
ridicule them, and many proverbial expressions refer to their want of intelligence
and polish. This ridicule, however, they hardly deserve. Less vivacious than
the Wallachian, or less supple than the Greek, the Bulgarian is certainly not
deficient in intelligence. But bondage has borne heavily upon him; and in the
south, where he is oppressed by the Turk and fleeced by the Greek, he looks
unhappy and sad; but in the plains of the north and the secluded mountain
villages, where he has been exposed to less suffering, he is jovial, fond of
pleasure, fluent of speech, and quick at repartee. The inhabitants of the northern
slopes of the Balkan, perhaps owing to a greater infusion of Servian blood, are
better-looking, too, than other Bulgarians, and dress in better taste. A still
finer race of men are the Pomakis, in the high valleys of the Rhodope, to the
south of Philippopoli. Their speech is Bulgarian, but in no other respect do
they resemble their compatriots. They are a fine race of men, with auburn
hair, full of energy, and of a poetical temperament. We almost feel tempted
to look upon them as the lineal descendants of the ancient Thracians, especially
if it should turn out to be true that in their songs they celebrate Orpheus, the
divine musician.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, and especially those of the plains, are a peaceable people,
recalling in no respect the fierce hordes who devastated the Byzantine empire.
They are not warlike, like their neighbours the Servians, and do not keep alive
in their national poetry the memory of former struggles. Their songs relate to
the events of every-day life, or to the sufferings of the oppressed; and the “gentle
<i>zaptieh</i>,” as the representative of authority, is one of the characters most
frequently represented in them. The average Bulgarian is a quiet, hard-working
peasant, a good husband and father; he is fond of home comforts, and practises
every domestic virtue. Nearly all the agricultural produce exported from Turkey
results from the labour of Bulgarian husbandmen. It is they who have converted
certain portions of the plain to the south of the Danube into
huge fields of <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
maize and corn, rivalling those of Rumania. It is they, likewise, who, at
Eski-Za’ara, at the south of the Balkan, produce the best silk and the best
wheat in all Turkey, from which latter alone the bread and cakes placed upon the
Sultan’s table are prepared. Other Bulgarians have converted the noble plain
of Kezanlik, at the foot of the Balkan, into the finest agricultural district of
Turkey, the town itself being surrounded by magnificent walnut-trees and by
rosaries, which furnish the famous attar of roses, constituting so important an
article of commerce throughout the East. Amongst the Bulgarians between
Pirot and Turnov (Tirnova), on the northern slope of the Balkan, there exist
flourishing manufactures. Each village there is noted for a particular branch of
industry. Knives are made at one, metal ornaments at another, earthenware at
a third, stuffs or carpets elsewhere; and even common workmen exhibit much
manual dexterity and purity of taste. An equally remarkable spirit of enterprise
is manifested amongst the Bulgarians and Zinzares of the district of Bitolia, or
Monastir. The town itself, as well as Kurshova, Florina, and others in its
vicinity, are manufacturing centres.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, peaceable, patient, and industrious as they are, are beginning
to grow tired of the subjection in which they are held. They certainly do not as
yet dream of a national rising, for the isolated revolts which have taken place
amongst them were confined to a few mountaineers, or brought about by young
men whom a residence in Servia or Rumania had imbued with an enthusiasm
for liberty. But though docile subjects still, the Bulgarians begin to raise
their heads. They have learnt to look upon each other as members of the same
nation, and are organizing themselves for the defence of their nationality. The
first step in this direction was taken on a question of religion. When the Turks
conquered the country a certain number amongst them turned Mo­ham­me­dan to
escape oppression; but though they visit the mosques, they nevertheless still
cling to the faith of their forefathers, venerate the same springs, and put their
trust in the same talismans. A few joined the Roman Church, but a great
majority remained Greek Catholics. Greek monks and priests, not long since,
enjoyed the greatest influence, for during centuries of oppression they had
upheld the ancient faith. Their presence vaguely recalled the times of independence,
and their churches were the only sanctuaries open to the persecuted
peasant. But the Bulgarians, in the end, grew discontented with a priesthood
who did not even take the trouble to acquire the language of its congregations, and
openly sought to subject them to an alien nation like the Greeks. Nothing
was further from their thoughts than a religious schism. They merely desired
to withdraw from the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and to found
a National Church of their own, as had been done by the Servians, and even by
the Greeks of the new Hellenic kingdom. The Vatican of Constantinople
protested, the Turkish Government proved anything but favourable to this
movement of emancipation, but in the end the Greek priests were forced to
retire—precipitately in some instances—and the new National Church was
established. <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span></p>

<p>This pacific revolution, though directed against the Greeks, cannot fail to
influence the relations between Bulgarians and Turks. The former have
combined, for the first time since many centuries, for the accomplishment of a
common national object, and this reawakening of a feeling of nationality cannot
but prove detrimental to the rule of the Osmanli. The latter are not very
numerous in the country districts of Western Bulgaria, where they are met
with chiefly in the towns, and particularly in those which are of strategical
importance. Eastern Bulgaria, however, is for the most part peopled by Turks,
or at all events by Bulgarians who have adopted the language, dress, manners,
and modes of thought of their conquerors. No Christian monastery exists in this
stronghold of Turkish power, though there are several Mo­ham­me­dan places of
pilgrimage held in high repute for their sanctity.</p>

<p>The Greeks, next to the Turks, are the most important element of the
population of Bulgaria. They are not very numerous to the north of the Balkan,
where their influence hardly exceeds that of the Germans and Armenians established
in the towns. To the south of the Balkan, though not numerous relatively,
they are much more widely distributed. One or two Greeks are met with in
every village, carrying on trade or exercising some handicraft. They make
themselves indispensable to the locality, their advice is sought for by all, and they
impart their own spirit to the whole of the population. Where two or three of
these Greeks meet they at once constitute themselves into a sort of community,
and throughout the country they form a kind of masonic brotherhood. Their
influence is thus far greater than could be expected from their numbers. There
are a few important Greek colonies amongst the Bulgarians, as at Philippopoli and
Bazarjik, and in a valley of the Rhodope they occupy the populous town of
Stanimako, to the exclusion of Turks and Bulgarians. The ruins of ancient
buildings, as well as the dialect of the inhabitants, which contains over two
hundred Greek words not known to modern Greek, prove that Stanimako has
existed as a Greek town for upwards of twenty centuries, and M. Dumont thinks
that it is one of the old colonies of Eubœa.</p>

<p>The initiatory part played by the Greeks in Southern Bulgaria is played
in the north by the Rumanians. The right bank of the Danube, from Chernavoda
to the Black Sea, is for the most part inhabited by Wallachians, who
are gradually gaining upon the Turks. Other colonists are attracted by
the fertility of the plains at the northern foot of the Balkan. The Bulgarians
are careful cultivators of the soil themselves, but the Rumanians nevertheless
gain a footing amongst them, as they do with the Servians, the
Magyars, and the Germans. They are more active and intelligent than the
Bulgarians, their families are more numerous, and in the course of a generation
they generally succeed in “Rumanising” a village in which they have
settled.</p>

<p>Bulgarians and Turks, Greeks and Wallachians, isolated colonies of Servians
and Albanians, communities of Armenians and of Spanish Jews, colonies of
Zinzares and wandering tribes of Mo­ham­me­dan Tsigani,
have converted the <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
countries of the Balkan into a veritable ethnological chaos; but the confusion is
greater still in the small district of Dobruja, between the Lower Danube and the
Black Sea. In addition to the races enumerated, we there meet with Nogai
Tartars, who are of purer blood than their kinsmen the Osmanli, and exhibit the
Asiatic type in greater purity. Although they cultivate the soil, they have not
altogether abandoned their nomad habits, for they wander with their herds over
hill and dale. They are governed by an hereditary khan, as at the time when they
dwelt in tents.</p>

<p>After the Crimean war several thousand Nogai Tartars, compromised by the
aid which they had rendered the Allies, joined their compatriots in the Dobruja.
On the other hand, about 10,000 Bulgarians, terrified at the approach of
these much-maligned immigrants, fled the Dobruja, and sought an asylum in
Russia, where they were assigned the lands abandoned by the Crimean Tartars.
This exchange proved disastrous to both nations, for sickness and grief carried off
many victims. More deplorable still was the lot of the Circassians and other
Caucasian tribes, who, to the number of 400,000, sought a refuge in Turkey in
1864. It was by no means easy to provide accommodation for so large a host.
The pasha intrusted with the installation of these immigrants sent many of them
to Western Bulgaria, in the vain hope that they would cut off all contact
between Servians and Bulgarians. The rayas were compelled to surrender to
them their best lands, to build houses for them, and to supply them with cattle
and seed-corn. This hospitable reception, compulsory though it was, would have
enabled these immigrants to start in their adopted country with a fair chance of
success, had they but deigned to work. This, however, they declined. Hunger,
sickness, and a climate very different from that of their mountains, caused them
to perish in thousands, and in less than a year about one-third of these refugees
had perished. Young girls and children were sold to procure bread, and this
infamous traffic became a source of wealth to certain pashas. The harems
became filled with young Circassians, who were a drug in the market at that
time, and the human merchandise not saleable at Constantinople was exported
to Syria and Egypt. These Circassians, after thus suffering from sickness and
their own improvident laziness, have now accommodated themselves to the
conditions of their new homes. Though of the same religion as the Osmanli, they
readily assimilate with the Bulgarians amongst whom they dwell, and adopt their
language.</p>

<p>Other refugees, more kindly treated by fate, have found an asylum in the
Dobruja. They are Russian Cossacks, Ruthenians, and Muscovites of the “Old
Faith,” who left their steppes towards the close of last century in order to escape
persecution. The Padisha, more tolerant than the Christian Empress of Russia,
generously received them, and granted them land in various parts of his
dominions. The Russian colonies in the Dobruja and in the delta of the Danube
have prospered, and one of their settlements on the St. George’s branch of the
river is known as the “Cossacks’ Paradise.” Most of these Russians are
engaged in the sturgeon fishery and the preparation of
caviare. They have <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
proved grateful for the hospitality extended to them, and have always fought
valiantly in defence of their adopted country. They retain their national
dress, their language, and their religion, and do not mix with the surrounding
populations.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we meet in the Dobruja with colonies of Germans,
Arabs, and Poles, and, in the new port of the Sulina, with representatives of
many nations of Europe and Asia.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>There are few countries where the great international high-roads are as plainly
traced by nature as in Bulgaria. The first of these roads is formed by the
Danube. The Turkish towns along its banks—Viddin, Shishtova, Rustchuk, and
Silistria—are taking an increasing share in European commerce. This highway
is continued along the shores of the Black Sea, where there are several commercial
harbours, the most important being Burgas, a great grain port. This natural
highway, however, has become too circuitous for purposes of commerce. A railway
has therefore been built across the isthmus of the Dobruja, from Chernavoda to
Kustenje, and a second line connects Rustchuk, on the Danube, with Varna, on the
Black Sea, the latter line crossing the whole of Eastern Bulgaria, and touching
the towns of Razgrad and Shumna. A third line, now in course of construction,
will cross the Balkans by a depression to the south of Shumna, and traversing the
plain in which the towns of Yamboly and Adrianople are built, will connect the
Lower Danube with the Ægean Sea. A third route, still farther to the west,
passes Turnov, or Tirnova—the ancient capital of the tsars of Bulgaria—Kezanlik,
and Eski-Za’ara.</p>

<p>These railways, already opened for traffic or approaching completion, certainly
shorten the journey between Western Europe and Constantinople; but it is
proposed now to avoid the circuitous navigation of the Lower Danube altogether,
by joining the railway system of Europe to that of Turkey. One of these proposed
railways will pass through Bosnia, and down the valley of the Vardar to
Saloniki; another will follow the ancient Roman road, which connected Pannonia
with Byzantium, and which was paved in the sixteenth century as far as Belgrad.
The principal cities along this great highway are Nish, on a tributary of the
Morava, close to the frontier of Servia; Sofia, the ancient Sardica, on the Isker,
a tributary of the Danube; Bazarjik, or “the market;” and the fine town of
Philippopoli, with its triple mountain commanding the passage of the Maritza.
These towns, on the completion of the railway, cannot fail to become of great commercial
importance. A hideous monument near Nish will, perhaps, be pointed out
to tourists attracted thither on the opening of the railway. It was erected to remind
future generations of a deed of “glory.” This trophy of Kele-kalesi consists of a
tower built of the skulls of Servians, who, rather than fall alive into the hands of
their enemies, blew themselves up together with the redoubt which they defended.
A governor of Nish, more humane than his predecessors, desired to remove this
abominable piece of masonry, which no raya passes without a shudder, but
Mussulman fanaticism forbade it. <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span></p>

<p>The influence of commerce cannot fail to modify largely the manners and
customs of a nation as supple and pliable as are the Bulgarians. War has
brutalised the Albanians, and slavery degraded the Bulgarians. In the towns,
more particularly, they have sunk very low. The insults heaped upon them by
Mussulmans, and the contemptuous manner in which they were treated, rendered
them abject and despicable in their own eyes. Demoralised by servitude and
misery, given up to the mercy of their rich compatriots, the <i>chorbajis</i>, or “givers
of soup,” they became shameless and low-minded helots. The Bulgarian women,
in the towns more particularly, presented a spectacle of the most shameful
corruption, and their want of modesty, their coarseness, and ignorance fully
justified the contempt in which they were held by their Mo­ham­me­dan sisters.
Even as regards education the Turks were in advance of them: not long ago their
schools relatively were more numerous, and the instruction given in them was of a
superior order. Christian villages, moreover, were never so clean or pleasant as
those of the Turks.</p>

<p>But, whatever may have been the case in the past, things have already begun
to mend. The Turks, as a body, may still be the superiors of the Bulgarians, as
regards probity and a respect for truth, but they work less, and become
impoverished by degrees. In the country the land gradually passes into the
hands of the rayas, in the towns the latter monopolize nearly all the trade. The
Bulgarians, moreover, have learnt to appreciate the importance of education;
they have founded schools and colleges, have set up printing presses, and send
their young men to be educated at the universities of Europe. The young
Bulgarians in the mixed colleges of Constantinople invariably make the most
satisfactory progress in their studies. This revival of learning is a most hopeful
sign of vitality. If persevered in, the Bulgarian race, which has been dead, as it
were, for so many centuries, may again play its part in the world’s history. The
atrocities of which Bulgaria has recently been the scene may retard this regeneration,
but they certainly cannot stop it.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn40" id="fnanch40">40</a>

<p class="pfirst">The
prophecies respecting the “sick man” have not yet been fulfilled, and his
heritage divided amongst the surrounding powers. To a great extent he is
indebted for this continued existence to the jealousies of the European powers, and
to the fact of Russia having her hands full in Central Asia. Still, Turkey has
recently exhibited a wonderful amount of vitality. Fresh provinces have been
incorporated with the empire in Arabia, at a distance of 1,800 miles from the
capital; and a rebellion in the north-western portion of European Turkey, originating
in the misgovernment of the country, but aided and abetted by Russia, has
been suppressed with a strong hand. The Turkish empire remains not only
intact, but will actually be found to have considerably increased in extent, if we
include within it the territories of the Khedive of Egypt, whose arms have been
carried to the Upper Nile and into Dar Fur.</p>

<p>We must guard ourselves, at the same time, against the assumption that
Turkey has entered upon a path of normal progress. On the contrary, Turkey is
a mediæval country still, and will have to pass through many intestine revolutions
before it can rank with the civilised states of Europe or America. The country is
in the occupation of hostile races, who would fall upon each other were they not
restrained by force. The Servian would take up arms against the Albanian, the
Bulgarian against the Greek, and all the subject races would combine against the
Turk. National jealousies are augmented by religious animosities. The Catholic
Bosnians hate other Slavs, and the Tosks detest the Gheges, although they speak
the same language. The Osmanli oppress these various populations without compunction,
their art of government consisting in playing them off against each
other.</p>

<p>Nor can better things be expected in an empire in which caprice reigns
supreme. The Padishah is lord of the souls and bodies of his subjects; he is
commander-in-chief of the army, supreme judge, and sovereign pontiff. In former
times his power was practically limited by semi-independent feudatories, but since
the fall of Ali Pasha and the massacre of the janissaries he is restrained only by
customs, traditions, and the demands of the Governments of Europe. He is the
most despotic sovereign of Europe, and his civil list the heaviest in proportion to
the revenues of the country. The household of the late Sultan and of the
members of his family was exceedingly numerous. There lived in the Seraglio
an army of 6,000 servants and slaves of both sexes, of whom 600 were cooks.
These servants, in turn, were surrounded by an army of hangers-on, who were fed
from the imperial kitchens, to which no less than 1,200 sheep were supplied daily
by the contractors.</p>

<p>Current expenses were sufficiently heavy, but more considerable still was the
extraordinary expenditure incurred in the construction of palaces and kiosks, the
purchase of articles <i>de luxe</i> and of curiosities, and for all kinds of prodigalities.
The present Sultan, driven thereto by the precarious position of his empire, has
limited his expenditure. But
will this last? <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span></p>

<p>Ministers, valis, and other high officials of the empire faithfully follow in the
footsteps of their sovereign, and their expenditure always exceeds their salary,
though the latter is fixed on a most liberal scale. As to the lower officials, their
salaries are small and irregularly paid; but it is understood that they may recoup
themselves at the expense of the ratepayers. Everything can be purchased in
Turkey, and, above all, justice. The state of the finances is most lamentable;
loans are raised at usurious interest; and so badly is the country governed that it
has been seriously proposed to intrust the management of its finances to a syndicate
of the European powers&#x202f;!&#x202f;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn41" id="fnanch41">41</a></p>

<p>Agriculture and industry progress but slowly under such misgovernment.
Vast tracts of the most fertile land are allowed to lie fallow; they appear to be
no one’s property, and any one may settle upon and cultivate them. But woe to
him if he conducts his operations with profit to himself; for no sooner is he
observed to become wealthy than his land is laid claim to on behalf of the clergy
or of some pasha, and he may consider himself lucky if he escapes a bastinado.
The peasants, in many districts, are careful not to produce more than they absolutely
require to live upon, for an abundant harvest would impoverish them—would
merely lead to a permanent increase of taxation. The tradesmen in the smaller
towns are equally careful to conceal their wealth, if they possess any.</p>

<p>Many Mussulman families have ceded to the mosques their proprietary rights.
They thus enjoy merely the usufruct of their lands, but are freed, on the other
hand, from the payment of taxes, and the land remains in the possession of their
families until they become extinct. These lands are known as <i>vakufs</i>, and they
form about one-third of the area of the whole empire. They contribute actually
nothing towards the revenues of the State. In the end they aggrandise the vast
estates of the Mo­ham­me­dan clergy. Taxation weighs almost exclusively upon the
lands cultivated by the unfortunate Christians; and in proportion as the vakufs
increase, so does the produce of taxation diminish. This must in the end necessarily
lead to a secularisation of the estates of the clergy; and even now, to the
great horror of the old Turks, the Ottoman Government is timidly extending its
hands towards the estates belonging to the mosques of Constantinople.</p>

<p>The Servian, Albanian, and Bulgarian peasants actually cultivate their land
in spite of their masters. A single fact will show this. Certain collectors of
tithes, in order to prevent fraud, insist upon the peasants leaving the whole of the
harvest upon the fields until they have withdrawn their tenth part. Maize, rice,
and corn are exposed there to the inclemencies of the weather and other destructive
agencies; and it frequently happens that the harvest has deteriorated to the
extent of one-half in value before the Government impost is levied. Sometimes
the peasants allow their grapes or fruit to rot rather than pay the tithes. But it
is not the tax-gatherer alone of whose conduct the peasant may complain; for he
is exposed likewise to exactions by the middlemen with whom he comes into
contact when selling his produce. “The Bulgarian works, but the Greek holds
the plough.” So says an ancient proverb; and this is still
true at least of the <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
countries to the south of the Balkan, where the Bulgarian peasant is not always
the proprietor of the land he tills. But where he does not directly work for a
Greek or Mussulman proprietor, his harvest, even before it is cut, is frequently
the property of a usurer; but he works on from day to day, a wretched slave, in
the vain hope of becoming one day a free man.</p>

<p>The fertility of the soil on both slopes of the Balkans, in Macedonia, and in
Thessaly is, however, such that in spite of mosques and tax-collectors, in spite of
usurers and thieves, agriculture supplies commerce with a large quantity of
produce. Maize, or “Turkish corn,” and all cereals are grown in abundance.
The valleys of the Karasu and Vardar produce cotton, tobacco, and dye stuffs;
the coast districts and islands yield wine and oil, whose quality would leave nought
to be desired, were a little more care bestowed upon their cultivation; and forests
of mulberry-trees are met with in certain parts of Thracia and Rumelia, and the
export of cocoons to Italy and France is increasing from year to year. Turkey,
with its fertile soil, is sure to take a prominent part amongst the European states
for the variety and superiority of its products. As to its manufactures, they will
no doubt be gradually displaced on the opening of new roads of commerce. The
manufacturers of arms, stuffs, carpets, and jewellery in the cities of the interior
will suffer considerably from foreign competition, and many amongst them will
succumb to it, unless they pass into the hands of foreigners. The great fairs,
too, which are now held annually at Slivno and other places, and at which
merchants from the whole of the empire meet to transact business—as many as a
hundred thousand strangers being attracted occasionally to a single spot—will
gradually give place to a regular commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>It is certain that the commerce of Turkey has increased of late years, thanks
to the efforts of Greeks, Armenians, and Franks of all nations. The annual
value of the exports and imports of the whole of the Ottoman empire in Europe
and Asia is estimated at £40,000,000—a very small sum, if we bear in mind the
resources of these countries, their many excellent harbours, and their favourable
geographical position.</p>

<p>The Turks themselves perform but a very small share of the work that is done
in their empire. Various causes combine to render them less active than the other
races. They are the governing class, and their ambition naturally aspires to the
honours and the luxury of <i>kief</i>; that is to say, of sweet idleness. Despising everything
not Mo­ham­me­dan, and being, besides, heedless and of a sluggish mind, they
but rarely learn foreign languages, and are thus in a certain measure at the mercy
of the other races, most of whom speak two or more idioms. Moreover, the
fatalism taught in the Koran has deprived the Turk of all enterprise, and once
thrown out of his ordinary routine, he is helpless. Polygamy and slavery are
likewise two causes of demoralisation. It is true that the rich alone can permit
themselves the luxury of a harem, but the poor learn from their superiors to
despise women, they become debased, and take a share in that traffic in human
flesh which is a necessary sequence of polygamy. Yet, in spite of the innumerable
slaves imported in the course of four centuries from all the
regions bordering upon <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
the Turkish empire; in spite of the millions of Circassian, Greek, and other girls
transplanted into the harems, the Osmanli are numerically inferior to the other races
of the peninsula. This dominant race—if the term race be applicable to the product
of so many crossings—hardly numbers ten per cent. of the population of European
Turkey. And this numerical inferiority is on the increase, for, owing to polygamy,
the number of children surviving in Mo­ham­me­dan families is less than in Christian
families. We are not in possession of precise figures, but there can be no doubt that
the Turks are on the decrease. The conscription, to which they alone are subject,
has contributed towards this result, and becomes more difficult from year to year.</p>

<p>It has often been repeated since Chateaubriand that the Turks have but camped
in Europe, and expect to return to the steppes whence they came. It would thus
be a feeling of presentiment which induces the Turks of Stambul to seek burial in
the cemetery of Scutari, hoping thus to save their bones from the profanation of
the Giaour’s tread on his return, as master, to Constantinople. In many places the
living follow the examples of the dead, and a feeble current of emigration sets from
the Archipelago and the coast districts of Thracia in the direction of Asia, carrying
along many an old Turk discontented with the stir of European life. This
migration, however, is but of very small importance, and does not affect the
Osmanli of the interior. Nothing is further from the minds of the Turks of
Bulgaria, the Yuruks of Macedonia, or the Koniarides, who have inhabited the mountains
of Rumelia since the eleventh century, than to quit the land which has become
their second home. The Turkish element in the Balkan peninsula can be got rid of
only by exterminating it; that is, by treating the Turks more ferociously than they
treated the native populations at the time of the conquest. We ought not to forget,
at the same time, that the Turks, though far inferior in numbers to the other
races, are nevertheless able to reckon upon the support of millions of Mo­ham­me­dan
Albanians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Circassians, and Nogai Tartars. The Mussulmans
constitute more than a third of the population of European Turkey, and, in spite
of differences of race, they hold firmly together. Nor must it be forgotten that
they are backed up by a hundred and fifty millions of co-religionists in other parts
of the world.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn42" id="fnanch42">42</a></p>

<p>Let us hope that the future may not give birth to a struggle of extermination
between the races of the peninsula, but rather to institutions enabling these diverse
and partially hostile elements to develop themselves in peace and liberty. The
Turks themselves begin to see the necessity of such institutions, and, in theory at
least, have abandoned their policy of violence and oppression. All the nationalities
of the empire, without reference to race or religion, are supposed to be
equal before the law, and Christians are admitted to Government offices on the same
terms as Mussulmans. No doubt these fine laws have for the most part hitherto
remained a dead letter, but it would nevertheless be unjust if we denied that much
progress towards an equalisation of the various races has been made.</p>

<p>Fortunately the despotism of the Turks is not the despotism of learning, based
upon a knowledge of human nature, and directed to its debasement. The Osmanli
ignore the art of “oppressing wisely,” which the Dutch governors of the Sunda
Islands were required to practise in former times, and which is not quite unknown
in other countries. The pashas allow things to take their course as long as they
are able to enrich themselves and their favourites, to sell justice and their favours
at a fair price, and to bastinade now and then some unlucky wight. They do not
inquire into the private concerns of their subjects, and do not call for confidential
reports on families and individuals. Their Government, no doubt, is frequently
violent and oppressive; but all this only touches externals. Such a government
may not be favourable to the development of public spirit, but it does not interfere
with individuals, and powerful national institutions, such as the Greek commune,
the Mirdit tribe, and the Slav community, have been able to survive under it. Self-government
is, in fact, more widely practised in Turkey than in the most advanced
countries of Western Europe. It would have been difficult to force these various
national elements under a uniform discipline, and the lazy Turkish functionaries
generally leave things alone. The Frankish officials in the pay of the Turkish
Government, in fact, more frequently interfere with the prejudices and privileges
of the governed than do the Mussulman pashas of the old school.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted for a moment that, in a time not very far distant, the
non-Mo­ham­me­dan races of Turkey will take the lead in politics, as they do already in
commerce, industry, and education. The Osmanli of the olden school, who still
wear the green turban of their ancestors, look forward towards this inevitable
result with despair. They struggle against every measure calculated to accelerate
the emancipation of the despised raya, and European inventions, in their eyes, are
working a great social transformation to their injury; and, indeed, it is the raya
who profits most from roads, railways, harbours, agricultural and other machines.
Bosnians, Bulgarians, and Servians have learnt to look upon each other as
brothers; Albanians and Rumanians are drawn towards the Greeks; all alike
feel themselves as Europeans; and thus the way is being paved for the Danubian
Confederation of the future.</p>

<p>The approaching completion of the railway from Vienna to Constantinople
cannot fail to work a commercial revolution as far as the trade of a considerable
portion of Eastern Europe is concerned. It will form a link in
the direct line <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
between England and India, and to travellers and merchandise will afford the
shortest route from the centre of Europe to the Bosporus. On its opening, Constantinople
will be enabled to avail itself to the fullest extent of the highways of
commerce which converge upon it. Still greater must be the political consequences
of opening this line, for it will bring the populations of the Balkan peninsula
into more direct and active contact with those of Austro-Hungary and the
rest of Europe.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The
Turkish empire occupies a vast area, the greater portion of which is governed
by vassals, almost independent of the Sultan at Stambul. The vast territories of
Egypt and Tunis are in that position. The interior of Arabia is in possession of
the Wahabites; the coast of Hadramaut is inhabited partly by tribes acknowledging
the suzerainty of England; and even between Syria and
the Euphrates there <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
are numerous districts only nominally under the government of Turkish pashas,
but in reality in the possession of predatory Bedwins. The Ottoman empire,
properly so called, includes the European provinces, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine,
the basins of Tigris and Euphrates, Hejaz and Yemen in Arabia, and Tripoli, with
Fezzan, in Africa. These territories, with their dependent islands, cover an area
of no less than 210,156 square miles; but their population, being far less dense
than that of Western Europe, hardly numbers 47,000,000 souls.</p>

<p>The area of Turkey in Europe, exclusive of Rumania, Servia, and Montenegro,
is about equal to that of the British Islands. Constantinople, with the surrounding
country, forms a district under the immediate supervision of the Ministry of
Police. The remainder of the country is divided into eight <i>vilayets</i>, or provinces;
the vilayets are subdivided into <i>mutesarifliks</i>, or <i>sanjaks</i>; these latter into <i>kazas</i>, or
cantons; and the kazas into <i>rahiés</i>, or parishes. Lemnos, Imbros, Samothrace, and
Astypalæa, with Rhodes and the islands along the coast of
Anatolia, form a <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
separate vilayet. These political divisions, however, are subject to frequent
changes.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn43" id="fnanch43">43</a></p>

<p>The Sultan, or <i>Padishah</i>, concentrates all powers within his person. He is <i>Emir
el mumenin</i>, or head of the faithful, and his conduct is guided solely by the prescriptions
of the Koran and the traditions of his ancestors. The two most influential
persons in the empire, next to him, are the <i>Sheik-el-Islam</i>, or Great Mufti, who
superintends public worship and the administration of justice, and the <i>Sadrazam</i>,
or Grand Vizier, who is at the head of the general administration, and is assisted
by a council of ten ministers, or <i>mushirs</i>. The <i>Kislar Agasi</i>, or chief of the black
eunuchs, to whom is confided the management of the imperial harem, is likewise
one of the great dignitaries of the empire, and frequently enjoys the very highest
influence. The legal advisers of the various ministries are known as <i>mufti</i>.
<i>Efendi</i>, <i>bey</i>, and <i>aga</i> are honorary titles bestowed upon certain Government
officials and persons of consideration. The title of <i>pasha</i>, which signifies “grand
chief,” is given to certain high civil or military functionaries. This title is
symbolized by one, two, or three horse-tails attached to the top of a lance, a
usage recalling the time when the nomad Turks roamed over the steppes of
Central Asia.</p>

<p>The work of the various ministries is done by councils, and there thus exist
a council of state, or <i>shuraï devlet</i>, councils of accounts, of war, of the navy, of
public education, of police, &amp;c. These various councils, in their totality, constitute
the <i>divan</i>, or government chancery. There is also a supreme court of
justice, with sections for civil and criminal cases. The members of these various
official bodies are appointed by Government. Each of the subject “nations”
is represented on the Council of State by two members, carefully selected by the
<i>Sadrazam</i>.</p>

<p>The vilayet is governed by a <i>vali</i>, the sanjak by a
<i>mutesarif</i>, the kaza by a <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
<i>kaimakan</i>, the parish by a <i>mudir</i>. Each of these is supposed to act by advice of
a council composed of the leading religious and civilian functionaries, Mo­ham­me­dan
and non-Mo­ham­me­dan. In reality, however, the vali appoints all these
councils, and they are popularly known as the “Councils of the Ayes.”</p>

<p>The rules laid down by the supreme Government for its own guidance are
embodied in the <i>hatti-sherif</i> of Gulhane, promulgated in 1839, and in the <i>hatti-humayum</i>
of 1856. These hatts promise equal rights to all the inhabitants of the
empire, but have been carried out hitherto only very partially. A “constitution”
was promulgated in December, 1876, on the assembling of the European Conference
at Constantinople. It provides representative institutions, local self-government,
and various improvements, but is likely to remain a dead letter.</p>

<p>The religious and judicial organization of the country is jealously watched
over by the Sheik-el-Islam and the priests, and cannot possibly be changed. The
<i>imans</i> are specially charged with the conduct of public worship. They include
<i>sheiks</i>, or preachers; <i>khatibs</i>, who recite the official prayers; and the <i>imans</i> properly
so called, who celebrate marriages and conduct interments. Judges and imans
form a body known as <i>ulemas</i>, at whose head is placed a <i>kazi-asker</i>, or chief judge,
and who are divided hierarchically into <i>mollahs</i>, <i>kazis</i> (kadis), and <i>naibs</i>.</p>

<p>The Greek Patriarch of Constantinople, as head of the Church in Turkey and
civil director of the Greek communities, wields a considerable influence. He is
elected by a synod of eighteen members, which administers the religious budget,
and whose decisions in matters of faith are final. The heads of the Latin rite
are a patriarch at Constantinople and the two Archbishops of Antivari and
Durazzo. The two Armenian Churches have each a patriarch at Constantinople.</p>

<p class="pfirst">It will be noticed that the preceding description of Turkey in Europe, and the
succeeding accounts of Rumania, Servia, and Montenegro, present the conditions
existing immediately prior to the late war with Russia, in which the Turks were
completely overpowered in a few months. The Congress of European powers
sitting at Berlin in the summer of 1878, to consider the preliminary treaty of San
Stefano (March 2) between Russia and Turkey, materially modified its provisions
in the joint treaty signed July 13, disposing of European Turkey in the following
manner: 1. The tributary principality of Bulgaria is created (with less than half
the dimensions assigned to it by the treaty of San Stefano), to be governed by a
prince (who shall not be a member of any ruling dynasty) chosen by the people
within nine months, and confirmed by the Porte and the other powers, and in the
mean time by Russian commissioners assisted by delegated European consuls. 2.
South of the Balkans is formed the autonomous province of Eastern Roumelia,
under a Christian governor-general, appointed for five years by the Porte with the
assent of the powers, which are to determine within three months the administrative
requirements of the province. 3. Bosnia and Herzegovina to
be occupied and <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
administered by Austria-Hungary, excepting Novi-Bazar and a small surrounding
district. This provision, unlimited as to time, practically annexes those provinces
to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and has already (October, 1878) been executed,
after serious armed resistance by their Moslem inhabitants. 4. Rumania, Servia,
and Montenegro are made independent, with the enlarged boundaries shown by
the annexed map. Rumania receives the Dobruja from Russia, to which it was
ceded by the treaty of San Stefano, with the understanding that it was to be exchanged
for the strip of Bessarabia transferred from Russia to Rumania by the
treaty of Paris of 1856, which has accordingly been restored. The additions to
Montenegro include the port of Antivari, which is closed to war-ships of all
nations; and Montenegro is to have no national flag nor ships of war, its merchant
flag to be protected by Austrian consuls. 5. Austrian Dalmatia receives from
Albania the small port of Spitza. 6. The services of the powers are offered
for the rectification of the northern frontier of Greece. 7. Entire religious liberty
and political equality are provided for in all the territories
affected by the treaty.</p>

Rumanians are certainly one of the most curious amongst
European nations. The descendants of the conquerors of the
ancient world, they live detached from, and far to the north-east
of, the other nations of the Greco-Latin family, and not
many years ago they were hardly known by name. The grave
events of which the Lower Danube has been the scene since the middle of this
century have brought these Rumanians prominently to the fore, and we know
now that they differ essentially from their neighbours, be they Slav, Turk, or
Magyar. They constitute, in fact, one of the most important elements amongst
the populations of Eastern Europe, and numerically they are the strongest nation
on the Lower Danube, the Bulgarians alone excepted.</p>

<p>The ethnological boundaries of Rumania are far wider than are the political
ones, for they embrace not only Wallachia and Moldavia beyond the Carpathians,
but also Russian Bessarabia, a portion of the Bukovina, the greater portion of
Transylvania, as well as extensive tracts in the Banat and Eastern Hungary.
The Rumanians have likewise crossed the Danube, and established themselves in
portions of Servia and Bulgaria; and the settlements of their kinsmen, the Zinzares,
sporadically extend far south to the hills of Thessaly and Greece. Rumania
proper has an area of only 46,709 square miles, but the countries of the Rumanians
occupy at least twice that extent, and their numbers exceed 8,000,000, most
of whom dwell in a compact mass on the Lower Danube and the adjoining
portions of Hungary and Russia.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn45" id="fnanch45">45</a></p>

<p>The Roman territories on the Lower Danube almost
encircle the mountain <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
masses of the Eastern Carpathians, as will be seen by a glance at our map, but
only about one-half of this territory has been formed into an autonomous state, the
remainder belonging to Hungary and Russia. If the national ambition of the
Rumanians were to be realised, the natural centre of their country would not lie
within the actual limits of the territory, but at Hermannstadt (called Sibiu by the
Wallachians), or elsewhere on the northern slope of the Carpathians. Thrust
beyond the Carpathians, and extending from the Iron Gate to the upper affluents
of the Pruth, the independent Rumanians occupy a country of most irregular
shape, and separated into two distinct portions by the river Sereth and one of its
tributaries, which join the most advanced spur of the Eastern Carpathians to the
great bend of the Lower Danube. To the north of this boundary lies Moldavia,
thus named after a tributary of the Sereth; to the south-west and west is Wallachia,
or the “Plain of the Welsh,” <i>i.e.</i> of the Latins. This plain, the <i>tzara Rumaneasca</i>,
or Roman-land proper, is intersected by numerous parallel water-courses, forming
as many secondary boundaries, and the river Olto separates it into Great
Wallachia to the east, and Little Wallachia to the west. The Danube forms the
political boundary down to its mouth. It is a wide and sinuous river; below the
Iron Gate, lakes, forests, and swamps render access to its banks almost impossible
in many places; and migratory nations and conquerors, instead of crossing it, as
they could easily have done in Austria and Bavaria, rather sought to avoid it by
seeking for a passage through the mountains to the north. The abrupt bend of the
Lower Danube and its extensive swampy delta still further shielded the plains of
Wallachia, and invaders not provided with vessels were thus turned to the north,
in the direction of the Carpathians. The lowlands of Moldavia were protected,
though in a less degree, by the rivers Dnieper, Bug, Dniester, and Pruth running
parallel with each other.</p>

<p>But, in spite of these natural bulwarks, it remains matter for surprise, and
proves the singular tenacity of the Rumanians, that they preserved their traditions,
their language, and nationality, in spite of the numerous onslaughts from
invaders of every race to which they were exposed. Ever since the retreat of
the Roman legions, the peaceable cultivators of these plains were preyed upon so
frequently by Goths, Huns, and Pecheneges, by Slavs, Bulgars, and Turks, that
their extinction as a race appeared to be inevitable. But they have emerged
from every deluge which threatened to destroy them, thanks, no doubt, to the
superior culture for which they were indebted to their ancestors, and again claim
a place amongst independent nations. They have fully justified their old proverb,
which says, <i>Romun no pere&#x202f;!</i>—“the Roman perishes not.”</p>

<p>The Transylvanian Alps lie within the territory of the Rumanians, who
occupy both slopes. Their upper valleys, however, are but thinly inhabited, and
we may travel for days without meeting with any habitations excepting the rude
huts of shepherds. The political boundary traced along the crest of the mountains
is merely an imaginary line, passing through the forest solitudes of vast
extent. Excepting near the only high-road, and the paths which join Transylvania
to the plains of Wallachia, these mountains remain in a state of nature.
The chamois is still hunted there, and not long since even bisons were met with.
The Tsigani penetrates these mountains in search of the brown or black bears
which he exhibits in the villages. He places a jar filled with brandy and honey
near the beast’s haunt, and, as soon as the bear and his family have become helplessly
intoxicated, they are seized and placed in chains.</p>

<p>The physical configuration of Rumania is extremely simple. In Moldavia low
ridges running parallel with the high mountain chain extend from the north-west
to the south-east, being separated from each other by the valleys of the Bistritza,
Moldava, and Sereth, and sinking down gradually into the plains of the Danube.
In Wallachia the southern spurs of the Transylvanian Alps ramify with remarkable
regularity, and the torrents which descend from them all run in the same
direction. The rivers, whether they rise at the foot of the hills or traverse the
entire width of the mountains, such as the Sil, Shil, or Jiul, the Olto or Aluta,
and the Buseo, turn towards the east before their waters mingle with those of the
Danube.</p>

<p>The slope of the hills is pretty uniform from the crest of the mountains to the
plain of the Danube, and the zones of temperature and vegetation succeed each
other with singular regularity. Summits covered with forests of conifers and
birch, and clad with snow during winter, rise near the frontiers of Transylvania.
These are succeeded by mountains of inferior height, where beeches and chestnuts
predominate, and all the picturesque beauties of European forest scenery are met
with. Lower still we come upon gentle hills, with groves of oaks and maples,
and their sunny sides covered with vines. Finally, we enter the wide plains of the
Danube, with their fruit trees, poplars, and willows. The zone lying between the
high mountains and the plain abounds in localities rendered delightful by picturesque
rocks, luxuriant and varied verdure, and limpid streams.
In this “happy <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
Arcadia” we meet with most of the large monasteries, magnificent castles with
domes and towers, standing in the midst of parks and gardens. As to the plains,
they are no doubt barren and monotonous in many places, but the villagers,
though their habitations are half buried in the ground, enjoy the magnificent
prospect of the blue mountains which bound the horizon. The most characteristic
objects in these lowlands are the huge hay-ricks already figured upon Trajan’s
column at Rome.</p>

<p>The Rumanian campagna is a second Lombardy, not because of the high state
of its agriculture, but because of the fertility of its soil, the beauty of the sky, and
of the distant views. Unfortunately there are no mountain barriers to protect it
against the cold north-easterly winds which predominate throughout the year.
Extremes of cold and heat have to be encountered.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn46" id="fnanch46">46</a> The vines have to be covered
with earth to protect them against the colds of winter; and in South-eastern
Wallachia, which is most exposed to the violence of the winds, it happens sometimes
that herds of cattle and horses, flying before a snow-storm, precipitate
themselves into the floods of the Danube. Several districts suffer from want of
rain, and are veritable steppes. Amongst these are the plains of the Baragan,
between the Danube and Yalomitza, where bustards abound, and a tree is not met
with for miles.</p>

<p>Geologically we meet with a regular succession of formations, from the granite
on the mountain summits to the alluvial deposits along the banks of the Danube.
The rocks encountered on these southern slopes of the Carpathians are of the same
kind as those found in Galicia on their northern slopes, and they yield the same
mineral products, such as rock-salt, gypsum, lithographic stones, and petroleum.
Tertiary strata predominate in the plains, but to the east of Ploiesti and Bucharest
only quaternary deposits of clay and pebbles are met with, in which are found
the bones of mammoths, elephants, and mastodons. The muddy rivers which
traverse these plains have excavated themselves sinuous beds, and resemble large
ditches.</p>

<p>The plain of Rumania, like that of Lombardy, is an ancient gulf of the sea
filled up by the débris washed down from the mountain sides. But though the sea
has retired, the Danube remains, pouring out vast volumes of water, and offering
great advantages to navigation. At the famous defile of the Iron Gate, where
this river enters the plain, its bed has a depth of 155 feet, its surface lies
66 feet above the level of the Black Sea, and its volume exceeds that of the combined
rivers of Western Europe, from the Rhone to the Rhine. The Romans, in
spite of this, had thrown a bridge across the river, immediately below the Iron
Gate, which was justly looked upon as one of the wonders of the world. This work
of architecture, which Apollodorus of Damas had erected in honour of Trajan, was
pulled down by order of the Emperor Hadrian, who was anxious to save the
expenses of the garrison required for its protection. There only remain now the
two abutments, and when the waters are low the foundations of sixteen out of the
twenty piers which supported the bridge may still be seen. A Roman tower, which
has given name to the little town of Turnu Severin, marks the spot where the
Romans first placed their foot upon the soil of Dacia. The passage from Servia
to Rumania is as important as it was of yore, but modern industry has not yet
replaced Trajan’s bridge.</p>

<p>The Danube, like most rivers of our northern hemisphere, presses upon its
right bank, and this accounts for the difference between its Wallachian and Bulgarian
banks. The latter, gnawed by the floods, rises steeply
into little hills and <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
terraces, whilst the former rises gently, and merges almost imperceptibly in the
plains of Wallachia. Swamps, lakes, creeks, and the remains of ancient river beds
form a riverine network, enclosing numerous islands and sand-banks. These
channels are subject to continual change, and to the south of the Yalomitza
may still be seen a line of swamps and lagoons, which marks the course of an
ancient river no longer existing. The lowlands on the Wallachian side of the
Danube are constantly increasing in extent, whilst Bulgaria continuously suffers
losses of territory. The latter, however, is amply compensated for this by the
salubrity of its soil and the fine sites for commercial emporiums which it offers.
It is said that the beaver, which has been exterminated almost in every
other part of Europe, is still common in these half-drowned lands of Wallachia.</p>

<p>At a distance of thirty-eight miles from the sea, in a straight line, the Danube
strikes against the granitic heights of the Dobruja, and abruptly turns to the
north, subsequently to spread out into a delta. In the course of this détour it
receives its last tributaries of importance, viz. the Moldavian Sereth and the
Pruth. Thirty miles below the mouth of the latter the Danube bifurcates. Its
main branch, known as that of Kilia, conveys about two-thirds of the entire
volume of its waters to the Black Sea, and forms the frontier between Rumania
and Turkish Bulgaria. The southern branch, or that of Tulcha, flows entirely
through Turkish territory. It separates into two branches, of which that of Sulina
is the main artery of navigation.</p>

<p>The main branch of the river is of the utmost importance when considering
the changes wrought upon the surface of the earth through aqueous agencies.
Below Ismail it ramifies into a multitude of channels, which change continuously,
new channels being excavated, whilst others become choked with alluvial deposits
carried down by the floods. Twice the waters of the river are reunited into a
single channel before they finally spread out into a secondary delta jutting into
the Black Sea. The exterior development of this new land amounts to about
twelve miles, and supposing the sea to be of a uniform depth of thirty-three feet, it
would advance annually at the rate of 660 feet. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase,
the coast, at the Kilia mouth, juts out far less to the east than it does in the
southern portion of the delta, and we may conclude from this that the ancient
gulf of the sea, now filled up by the alluvial deposits brought down by the Kilia
branch, was far larger and deeper than those to the south.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn47" id="fnanch47">47</a> On examining a map
of the Danubian delta, it will be found that, by prolonging the coast-line of
Bessarabia towards the south, it crosses the delta. This is the ancient coast. It
rises above the half-drowned plains like an embankment, through which the
branches of the river forced themselves a passage to the sea. The alluvium
brought down by the Sulina and St. George’s mouths has been spread over a vast
plain lying outside this embankment, whilst that carried down through what is at
present the main branch forms only a small archipelago
of ill-defined islands <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
beyond it. We may conclude from this that the latter is of more recent origin
than the other arms.</p>

<p>In the course of its gradual encroachment upon the sea, the river has cut off several
lakes of considerable extent. On the coast between the mouth of the Dniester and
the delta of the Danube there are several lagoons, or <i>limans</i>, of inconsiderable
depth, the water of which evaporates during the heat of summer, depositing a thin
crust of salt. In their general configuration, the nature of the surrounding land,
and parallelism of the rivers which flow into them, these sheets of water are very
much like the lakes met with more to the west, as far as the mouth of the
Pruth. These latter, however, are filled with fresh water, and the sandy barriers at
their lower ends separate them not from the Black Sea, but from the Danube.
There can be no doubt that these lakes were anciently gulfs of the sea, similar in all
respects to the lagoons still existing along the coast. The Danube, by converting
its ancient gulf into a delta, separated them from the sea, and their saline water
was replaced by fresh water carried down by the rivers. The existing saline
lagoons will undergo the same metamorphosis, in proportion as the delta of the
Danube gains upon the sea.</p>

<p>The plains of Wallachia were defended formerly by an ancient line of fortifications
passing to the north of these Danubian lakes and lagoons, and known as
“Trajan’s Wall,” like the ditches, walls, and entrenched camps in the Southern
Dobruja. The inhabitants ascribe their construction to Cæsar, although
they are of <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
much later date, having been erected by Trajan as a protection against the Visigoths.
This ancient barrier of defence coincided pretty nearly with the political boundary
between Russian and Rumanian Bessarabia, and extended probably to the west of
the Pruth, across the whole of Moldavia and Wallachia. Vestiges of it still met
with there are known as the “Road of the Avares.” A second wall, still traceable
between Leova and Bender, defended the approaches to the valley of the Danube.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In spite of the diverse races which have overrun, conquered, or devastated
their territory, the inhabitants of Rumania, more fortunate than their neighbours,
have preserved their unity of race and language. Wallachians and Moldavians
form one people, and not only have they kept intact their national territory, but
they have actually encroached upon the territories of their neighbours. Throughout
Rumania, with the exception of that portion of Bessarabia ceded by the
Western powers after the Crimean war, the inhabitants belonging to alien races
are in the minority.</p>

<p>The origin of this Latin-speaking nation is still shrouded in mystery. Are
they the descendants of Getæ and Latinised Dacians, or does the blood of Italian
colonists brought thither by Trajan, of legionaries and Roman soldiers, predominate
amongst them? To what extent have they become amalgamated with their
neighbours, the Slavs and Illyrians? What share had the Celts in the formation
of their nationality? Are the “Little” Wallachians, the “men with the eighty
teeth,”—so called on account of their bravery,—the descendants of Celts? We
cannot say with certainty, for men of learning like Shafarik and Miklosich differ
on all these points. The vast plains at present inhabited by the Rumanians
became a wilderness in the third century, when the Emperor Aurelian compelled
their inhabitants to migrate to the right bank of the Danube. If it is true that
the descendants of these emigrants ever returned to the seats of their ancestors, in
the meantime occupied by Slavs, Magyars, and Pecheneges, when did they do so?
Miklosich presumes that they did so towards the close of the fifth century;
Roesler thinks in the fourteenth, although ancient chroniclers of the eleventh
century mention Rumanians as dwelling in the Carpathians. Other authorities
deny that there was any re-immigration; they maintain that the residue of
the Latinised population sufficed for reconstituting the nationality. Thus much
is certain, that this small people has increased wonderfully, and has become now
the preponderating race on the Lower Danube and in Transylvania.</p>

<p>Even in the seventeenth century the language spoken by the Rumanians
was treated as a rural dialect, and Slavonian was used in churches and courts
of justice. At the present day, on the contrary, Rumanian patriots are anxious
to purge their language of all Servian words, and of Greek and Turkish
expressions introduced during the dominion of the Osmanli. The “Romans”
of the Danube are endeavouring to polish their tongue, so that it may rank
with Italian and French. They have abandoned the Russian characters,
and their vocabulary is being continually enriched by new words derived
from the Latin. The idiom spoken in the towns,
which was the most impure <span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span>
formerly, in consequence of the influx of strangers, has now become more Latin
than that spoken in the country. There are, however, about two hundred
words not traceable to any known tongue, and these are supposed to be a remnant
of the ancient Dacian spoken at the period of the Roman invasion. The Wallachian
differs, moreover, from the Latin tongues of Western Europe by always
placing the article and the demonstrative pronoun after the noun. The same rule
obtains in Albanian and Bulgarian, and Miklosich is probably right when he
looks upon this as a feature of the ancient language of the aborigines.</p>

<p>These niceties, however, are altogether unnoticed by the mass of the people.
The Rumanian peasant is proud of the ancient conquerors of his country, and
looks upon himself as the descendant of the patricians of Rome. Several of his
customs, at the birth of children, betrothals, or burials, recall those observed by
the Romans, and the dance of the <i>Calushares</i>, it is said, may be traced back to
the earliest Italian settlers. The Wallachian is fond of talking about Father
Trajan, to whom he attributes all those feats which in other countries are
associated with Hercules, Fingal, or Ossian. Many a mountain valley has been
rent asunder by Trajan’s powerful hand; and the avalanches descending from the
hills are spoken of as Trajan’s thunder. The Rumanian completely ignores
Getæ, Dacians, or Goths, though in the hills we still meet with tall men having
blue eyes and long flaxen hair, who are probably descended from the aboriginal
inhabitants of the country.</p>

<p>The Rumanians have generally fine sunburnt features, fair hair, expressive
eyes, a mouth finely shaped, and beautiful teeth. They allow their hair to grow
long, and sometimes even prefer to expatriate themselves to sacrificing it to the
exigencies of military service. They exhibit grace in all their movements, are
indefatigable on the march, and support the heaviest labour without complaining.
Even the Wallachian herdsman, with his sheepskin cap, or <i>cashula</i>, his wide
leather belt used as a pocket, a sheepskin thrown over his shoulders, and drawers
which recall those of the Dacians sculptured on Trajan’s Column, is noble in his
bearing. In the large towns, where much intermixture has taken place with
Greeks, Southern Russians, and Magyars, the brown complexion predominates.
The Rumanian women are grace itself. They always charm us by taste and
neatness, whether they have adopted a modern dress or still patronise the
national costume, consisting of an embroidered chemisette, a floating vest, a party-coloured
apron, a golden net, and golden sequins placed in the hair. These
external advantages are combined in the Rumanian with quickness of apprehension,
a gay spirit, and the gift of repartee, which entitle them to be called the
Parisians of the Orient.</p>

<p>In the midst of this homogeneous Rumanian population we meet with
Bulgarian colonists, whose number has increased recently in consequence of
the persecutions of Turks and Greeks. The character of the Bulgarians born in
the country has undergone considerable modifications. They are at present the
most industrious tillers of the soil, and in the vicinity of large towns they occupy
themselves principally with horticulture. Many of these Bulgarians
live in that <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
portion of Bessarabia which was ceded by Russia in 1855. They settled there in
1829, more particularly in the <i>Budzak</i>, or southern “corner” of Bessarabia, and
their fields are better tilled, their roads in better condition, than those of their
Moldavian neighbours. Their villages still bear Tartar names, from the time
when their country was occupied by Nogai Tartars, and they contrast favourably
with the villages of the surrounding peoples. Bolgrad, the capital of this colony,
is a small bustling town, the schools of which enjoy a high reputation. These
Bulgarians, so distinguished for industry, sobriety, and thrift, have more or less
amalgamated with Russians, Greeks, and gipsies, and they talk almost every
language of the East.</p>

<p>The Russians of Moldavian Bessarabia have their settlements on the banks of
the Danube, to the east of these Bulgarian colonies. They, too, are good
agriculturists. The Russians met with in the towns are generally engaged in
commerce, and enjoy a high reputation for honesty. Most of them belong to the
old sect of the <i>Lipovani</i>, and fled from Russia about a century ago to escape religious
persecution. They nearly all speak Rumanian. Vilkof, a village near the
mouth of the Danube, is almost exclusively occupied by these Lipovani, who are
expert fishermen, and share the produce of their labour in common. Others
amongst the Russians belong to the sect of the <i>Skoptzi</i>, or “mutilated,” which
is said to recruit itself by stealing children. These Skoptzi are recognised by
their portliness and smooth faces, and at Bucharest they are reputed to be excellent
coachmen.</p>

<p>Magyar Szeklers from Transylvania, known in the country as <i>Changhei</i>, are
the only other foreign element of the population occupying distinct settlements.
These Changhei, who first came into the country when the Kings of Hungary
were masters of the valley of the Sereth, are
gradually becoming Rumanians <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
in dress and language, and would have become so long ago were they not Roman
Catholics, whilst the people among whom they live are Greeks. They are joined
annually by a few compatriots from Transylvania, attracted by the mild climate
and the fertility of the soil. In spring and autumn large bands of Hungarian
reapers and labourers descend into the plains of Moldavia.</p>

<p>The Hellenic element was strongly represented last century, when the
government of the country was farmed out by the Sultan to Greek merchants
of Constantinople. At the present time the Greeks are not numerous—not
exceeding, perhaps, 10,000 souls, even if we include amongst them Hellenized
Zinzares—but they occupy influential positions as managers of estates or
merchants, and the export of corn is almost exclusively in their hands. Traces
of the ancient government of these Phanariotes still exist in the language of
the country, and in the relationships resulting from intermarriages between
seignorial families. Far more numerous than these Greeks, and of greater
importance, are the members of those homeless nations—the Jews and Tsigani
(or gipsies). A few Spanish Jews are met with in the large towns, but the
majority are “German” Jews, who have come hither from Poland, Little Russia,
Galicia, and Hungary. As publicans and middlemen they come into close
contact with the poor people, and they are universally detested, not on account
of their religion, but because of the wonderful skill with which they manage to
secure the savings of the people. Imaginary crimes of all kinds are attributed
to them, and they have repeatedly been exposed to maltreatment on the
frivolous charge of having eaten little children at their Passover. The Rumanians,
however, can hardly manage without these detested Jews, and their laws,
by preventing the Jews from acquiring land, fortify their commercial monopoly.
The Jews, if certain estimates may be credited, constitute one-fifth of the total
population of Moldavia. The Armenians, the other great commercial people of
the Orient, are represented by a few flourishing colonies, more especially in
Moldavia. These Haikanes are the descendants of immigrants who settled in the
country at various epochs between the eleventh and seventeenth centuries. They
live amongst themselves, and, though not exactly liked by the people, they have
known how to avoid becoming objects of hatred. A few Armenians from Constantinople,
and speaking Turkish, are met with on the Lower Danube.</p>

<p>The Tsigani, or gipsies, so despised formerly, become merged by degrees in
the rest of the population. Not long ago they were slaves, the property of the
State, of boyards, or monasteries. They led a wandering life—working, trafficking,
or stealing for the benefit of their masters. They were divided into castes, the
principal of which were the <i>lingurari</i>, or spoon-makers; <i>ursari</i>, or bear-leaders;
<i>ferrari</i>, or smiths; <i>aurari</i>, or collectors of gold dust; and <i>lautari</i>, or musicians.
These latter were the most polished of all, and were employed to celebrate the
glory and the virtues of the boyards. They are now the minstrels of the country
and the musicians of the town. Very few in number are the <i>Netotzi</i>, a degraded
caste who live in woods or tents, subsist upon the foulest food, and do not bury
their dead. The Tsigani were assimilated in 1837 with the
peasantry, and since <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
their emancipation nearly all of them lead a settled life, cultivating the soil with
great care, or exercising some handicraft. The fusion between Tsigani and
Rumanians is making rapid progress, for both races have the same religion and
speak the same language. Intermarriages between the two are frequent, and in
a time not far off the Tsigani of Rumania will be a thing of the past. They are
supposed still to number between 100,000 and 300,000 souls.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn48" id="fnanch48">48</a></p>

<p>The Rumanian nation is still in a state of transition from a feudal to a
modern epoch. The revolution of 1848 shook the ancient system to its foundation,
but did not destroy it. As recently as 1856 the peasants were attached to
the soil. They had no rights, but were at the mercy of the boyards and monasteries
whose soil they were doomed to till, and lived in miserable hovels. The
whole of the country and its inhabitants belonged to five or six thousand boyards,
who were either the descendants of the ancient “braves,” or had purchased their
patents of nobility. Most of these boyards were only small proprietors, and nearly
the whole of the land belonged to seventy feudatories in Wallachia, and three
hundred in Moldavia.</p>

<p>This state of affairs led to the most frightful demoralisation amongst masters
and serfs, and even the good qualities of the Rumanian—his energy, his generosity,
and friendliness—were turned into evil. The nobles lived far away from
their estates, spending the income forwarded by their Greek bailiffs in debauchery
and gambling. The peasants worked but little, for they had no share in the
produce of the soil; they were mistrustful and full of deceit, as are all slaves;
they were ignorant and superstitious, for they depended for their education upon
illiterate and fanatical priests. Their <i>popes</i> were magicians, and cured maladies
by incantations and holy philtres. As to the monks, some of them were rich
proprietors, as rapacious as the temporal lords; others lived on alms, having
exchanged a life of slavery for mendicity.</p>

<p>Not long ago the Rumanians, deprived of all education except that supplied
by their <i>doinas</i>, or ancient songs, were lost almost in mediæval darkness.
Even now some of the ancient customs of their ancestors survive in the rural
districts. Funerals are attended by hired weeping women, whose shrieks
accompany the farewell of relatives. Into the coffin they place a stick upon
which to rest when crossing the Jordan, a piece of cloth to serve as a garment,
and a coin as a bribe to St. Peter for opening the gate of heaven. Nor are wine
and bread forgotten for the journey. Red-haired people are suspected of
returning to earth in the guise of a dog, a frog, or a flea, and to penetrate into
houses in order to suck the blood of good-looking young girls. In their case it is
as well to close the coffin-lid tightly, or, still better, to pierce the throat of the
defunct with a stick.</p>

<p>The peasantry will doubtless no longer be haunted by these
hallucinations, for the <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
moral and intellectual progress of the nation has kept pace with its material prosperity
since the peasant has cultivated his own land. Officially made a freeman
in 1856, but held for several years afterwards in a kind of limited bondage, the
peasant now owns at least a portion of the land. By a law passed in 1862, each
head of a family is entitled to a plot of land from seven to sixty-seven acres in
extent, and ever since that time the peasants have gained immensely in self-respect.
His land, though still cultivated with the ancient Roman plough, and
deprived of manure, produces immense quantities of cereals, the sale of which
brings wealth into the country and encourages progress. Rumania is now one
of the great corn-exporting countries of Europe, and in favourable years, when
the crops are neither eaten up by locusts nor destroyed by frosts, its exports exceed
those of Hungary. In less than ten years the export of wheat, maize, barley, and
oats has doubled, and the sum annually realised varies between £4,000,000 and
£8,000,000 sterling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the peasants eat but little of the corn they grow. They are
content with the maize, from which they prepare their <i>mamaligo</i> and the detestable
spirits which cheer their hearts on a hundred and ninety-four annual fête days. The
cultivation of the vine, which was altogether neglected formerly, is likewise making
progress, and the produce of the foot-hills of the Carpathians is justly esteemed.
The time is past now when “Wallachian” and “herdsman” were synonyms
throughout the East. Still, nearly one-fourth of the area of the country remains
uncultivated, and the soil is allowed to lie fallow every third year. Moldavia is
better cultivated, upon the whole, than Wallachia, and this is principally owing
to the fact of the Moldavian boyards residing upon their estates, and taking a pride
in their management. Progress, however, is apparent throughout the country, and
there is hardly a large estate without its steam threshing-machine. Even the
small proprietors are gradually introducing improved methods of cultivation, and
in many villages they have formed co-operative associations for the cultivation of
extensive tracts of country.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn49" id="fnanch49">49</a></p>

<p>Rumania is essentially an agricultural country. The ores of the Carpathians
are not utilised, for there are no roads which give access to them. The petroleum
wells only supplied 3,810,000 gallons in 1873. Four of the principal salt-works
are carried on by Government, partly with the aid of convict labour, and yield
annually 80,000 tons of salt. The fisheries are of some importance. The inhabitants
on the Lower Danube salt the fish which abound in the river and
the neighbouring lakes, and prepare caviare from sturgeons. There are no
manufactories excepting near the large towns, and the country is noted only for
its carpets, embroidered cloth and leather, and pottery. The housewives are
famed for their confectionery.</p>

<p>Commerce is annually on the increase.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn50" id="fnanch50">50</a> Its only outlet in
former times was <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
the Danube. Nearly the whole produce of the country was carried to Galatz,
at the bend of the river, upon which the principal routes of the country converge.
For many years to come the Danube will remain the great commercial
highway of the country; the Pruth, too, is navigable for small steamers as far as
Sculeni, to the north of Yassy; whilst the numerous rivers descending from the
Carpathians will always prove useful for the conveyance of timber. New outlets
have been created by the construction of railways. Rumania is now joined to
the railway systems of Austria and Hungary, and the proposed bridge across the
Danube will place it in direct communication with Varna, on the Black Sea.
The level nature of the country facilitates the construction of railways, but its
inhabitants look upon their extension with a feeling of apprehension, for they
fancy that a commercial invasion may bring in its train a military one.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn51" id="fnanch51">51</a></p>

<p>The Rumanians complain much about the left bank of the Sulina branch of
the Danube not having been ceded to them by the treaty of Paris. In former
times the whole of the delta of the Danube belonged to Moldavia, as is proved
by the ruins of a town built by the Rumanians on the southern bank of the
river, opposite to Kilia. Up to the close of last century the jurisdiction of
the Moldavian governor of Ismail extended to the port of Sulina, and he was
charged with keeping the mouth of the river free from obstructions. The
Western powers, in spite of this, allowed Turkey to occupy the whole of the
delta, whilst they confined the Rumanians to the left bank of the Kilia branch.
The country, consequently, has no direct access to the Black Sea, except by means
of small vessels, for the mouth of the Kilia branch is obstructed by a bar.
M. Desjardins and other engineers who have devoted some attention to the
subject propose to construct a ship canal, about eight miles in length, which will
connect the Danube with the Bay of Sibriani. In the meantime Rumania is at
liberty to make use of the Sulina mouth, which is kept open at the expense
of the Western powers, and a canal, therefore, hardly appears to be called for.</p>

<p>Bucharest (or Bucuresci, pron. Bukureshti), the capital of Wallachia and of the
whole of Rumania, already numbers amongst the great cities of Europe. Next to
Constantinople and Buda-Pest, it is the most populous town of South-eastern
Europe, and its inhabitants fondly speak of it as the “Paris of the Orient.”
The town not very long since was hardly more than a collection of villages,
very picturesque from a distance on account of numerous towers and glittering
domes rising above the surrounding verdure, but very unpleasant within. But
Bucharest has been transformed rapidly with the increasing wealth of its
inhabitants. It may boast now of wide and clean streets, bounded by fine
houses, of public squares full of animation, and of well-kept parks, and fully
deserves now its sobriquet of the “joyful city.”</p>

<p>Yassy (Jasi, or Yashi), which became the capital of
Moldavia when Suchova was annexed by Austria, occupies a
position far less central than does Bucharest, but the
fertility of the surrounding country, the proximity of the
navigable <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
Pruth and of Russia, with which it maintains a brisk commerce, and its position
on the high-road joining the Baltic to the Black Sea, have caused it to increase
rapidly in population. It is a flourishing town now, though no longer the seat
of an independent government. Built upon the foot-hills of the Carpathians,
the city presents itself magnificently from afar, and its exterior is not belied by
its finer quarters. Jews, Armenians, Russians, Tsigani, Tartars, and Magyars
are numerously represented amongst its population, which is semi-Oriental in
type. We may almost fancy ourselves standing upon the threshold of Asia.
The church of the Three Saints is distinguished for its originality, and is a masterpiece
of ornamentation in the Moorish style.</p>

<p>All the other towns of Rumania are indebted for their importance to their
position on commercial high-roads. Botosani, in Northern Moldavia, lies on the
road to Galicia and Poland, and the same may be said of Falticeni, whose international
fairs are always well attended. Commerce causes the towns on the
Danube to flourish. Vilkof is a great mart for fish and caviare; Kilia, the
ancient Achillea, or city of Achilles; Ismail, where the Russian Lipovani are
numerous; Reni; Galatz, said to be an ancient colony of the
Galatians, now the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
most important commercial emporium on the Lower Danube, and seat of the
European commissioners for its regulation; Braila, a poor village as long as the
Turks held it, but now important on account of its grain trade, and the literary
centre of the Bulgarians. All these towns, though situated on the banks of the
Danube, may be looked upon almost as ports of the Black Sea, through which the
produce of the country, and especially its grain, finds an outlet to foreign
markets. Giurgiu (Jurjevo) is the port of Bucharest on the Danube; Turnu-Severinu
is the gateway of Wallachia, below the great narrows of the river;
Craiova, Pitesci, Ploiesti, Buzeu, and Focsani form the terminal points of the
roads descending from the high valleys of Transylvania. Alecsandria, a town
recently built in the centre of the plain which extends from Bucharest to the Olto,
has become a depôt for agricultural produce.</p>

<p>Formerly, when incessant wars rendered a strong strategical position of
greater importance than commercial advantages, the capital of the country was
established in the very heart of the Carpathians. In the thirteenth century it
was at Campu-Lungu, in the midst of the mountains, and subsequently it was
transferred to Curtea d’Argesia, founded by Prince Negoze Bessaraba in the
beginning of the sixteenth century. Of this ancient capital there remain now
only a monastery and a wonderful church: the walls, cornices, and towers are
covered with sculptures, like the work of a jeweller. Targu-Vestea, or Tirgovist,
on the Yalomitza, was the third capital, but of the fine palace built there by the
<i>domni</i> there remain now only blackened walls.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn52" id="fnanch52">52</a></p>

<p>Rumania includes the two ancient principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia,
and forms a semi-independent state under the protection of the great powers,
and paying an annual tribute of about £40,000 to the Porte. The country
has placed a member of the Hohenzollern family at the head of the State. The
constitution of 1866 confers upon this prince the right of appointing all public
functionaries and the officers of the army, of coining money, and of pardoning.
All laws require his signature before they can be enforced. He enjoys a civil list
of £48,000.</p>

<p>The legislative powers are vested in two chambers, the members of which are
elected by a process designed to favour the interests of the rich. All Rumanians
above twenty-one years of age, except servants in receipt of wages, are inscribed in
the electoral lists. They are divided into four “colleges,” or classes, having widely
different privileges. The first college includes all those electors of a district
whose income from landed property amounts to £132 a year; electors having an
income of between £44 and £132 form a second
college; merchants and <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
tradesmen of the towns paying a tax of 23<i>s.</i> annually, Government pensioners,
half-pay officers, professors and graduates of universities, form the third college;
and the remainder of the electors belong to the fourth college. The first two
colleges elect a deputy each for their district; the third college elects from
one to six deputies for each town, according to its size; the fourth college elects
delegates by whom the representatives are chosen.</p>

<p>The Senate represents more especially the large landed proprietors. Senators
must have an income of £352, and are elected by the landed proprietors whose
income amounts to at least £132 a year. The universities of Bucharest and
Yassy are represented by a senator each, elected by the professors, and the crown
prince, the metropolitan, and the diocesan bishops are <i>ex-officio</i> members of the
Senate. Senators are elected for eight, and deputies for four years.</p>

<p>The Rumanian constitution grants all those rights and privileges usually set
forth in documents of that kind. The right of meeting is guaranteed; there is
liberty of the press; the municipal officers and mayors are elected, but the Prince
may intervene in the case of towns inhabited by more than a thousand families;
the punishment of death is abolished, except in time of war; and education is free
and compulsory “wherever there are schools.” There is liberty of religion,
though there is a State Church, and Christians alone can be naturalised. No
marriage is legal unless it has been consecrated by a priest. The Rumanian
Church, as far as dogmas are concerned, is that of the Greeks, but it is altogether
independent of the Greek patriarch residing at Constantinople, and is governed
by its own Synod. Most of the monasteries have been secularised.</p>

<p>The country is divided into four judicial districts, each having a court of
appeal, whilst a supreme court sits at Bucharest. The French codes, slightly
modified, were introduced in 1865.</p>

<p>The army is partly modelled upon that of Prussia. All citizens are called
upon to serve sixteen years, eight of which are passed in the standing army or its
reserve, and eight in the militia. The National Guard includes all men up to
fifty not belonging to either of the other categories. By calling out all its men,
Rumania can easily send an army of 100,000 men into the field. There are likewise
a few gunboats on the Danube.</p>

<p>The finances of Rumania are in a more satisfactory condition than those of
most other states of Europe. The Government has certainly been living upon
loans, for which eight per cent. has to be paid, and nearly the whole of the annual
income is spent upon the payment of interest, the army, and the revenue services.
The credit of Rumania is, however, good, for the loans are secured upon vast
domains, the property of the secularised monasteries, several thousand acres of
which are sold every year. The sale of salt and the manufacture of tobacco are
Government monopolies.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn53" id="fnanch53">53</a></p>

<p>Rumania is divided for administrative purposes into 33 departments
and 164 districts, or <i>plasi</i>. There are 62 towns and 3,020 rural
communes.</p>

like Rumania, was un­til re­cent­ly a semi-in­de­pen­dent state,
paying a tribute of £25,000 a year to the Porte, and submitting to
the presence of a Turkish garrison at Mali-Zvornik, on the Bosnian
frontier. But even these vestiges of ancient oppression irritated
the national pride to an inconceivable degree, and the moment
when a blow might be struck on behalf of Servia and the neighbouring countries
inhabited by Slavs still groaning under the Turkish yoke was looked forward to
with impatience. The blow has been struck, and were it not for the support
extended to it by the great powers, Servia would ere this have ceased to exist as a
semi-independent state.</p>

<p>Servia, within its actual limits, includes only a small portion of the northern
slope of the mountains rising in the centre of the Balkan peninsula. It is
separated from Austro-Hungary by the Save and the Danube, but no natural
boundary divides it from Turkey; and the valleys of the Morava, the Drina, and
the Timok, the former in the centre, the others on the eastern and western
frontiers of the country, afford easy access to a foreign invader. The difficulties
to be surmounted by the latter would begin only after he had entered the vast
forests, the narrow valleys, and unfathomable <i>klisuras</i> amongst the mountains.</p>

<p>The only plains of any extent are on the banks of the Save. Everywhere else
the country is hilly, rocky, or mountainous. The most prominent mountain
range is that which extends from the “Iron Gate” and the defile of Kasan, on
the Danube, through Eastern Servia, and forms a marked continuation of the Transylvanian
Alps, with which it agrees in geological structure. In the northern
portion of these Servian Carpathians, in the angle formed by the confluence of the
Danube and Morava, where masses of porphyry have burst through limestones
and schists, we find ourselves in the great mineral
region of Servia. Copper, <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
iron, and lead ores are being worked here, especially at Maidanpek and Kuchaina,
but the old zinc and silver mines have been abandoned. The valley of the
Timok, in the southern portion of this mountain range, is likewise rich in
minerals, and gold dust is collected from the sand of the river. There are few
valleys which can rival that of the Timok in beauty and fertility, and the basin
of Knyashevatz, where the head-streams of the river unite, is more especially
distinguished by its rural beauty, sparkling rivulets flowing through the
meadows, vines covering the hills, and forests the surrounding mountains. A
narrow defile immediately below this basin leads into the valley of Zaichar, near
which, at Gamzigrad, there still exist ruins of a Roman fortress, its walls and
towers of porphyry in a capital state of preservation. Looking northward from
this position we perceive the Stol (3,638 feet), whilst in the south-west there rises
a huge pyramid of chalk, which might almost be mistaken for the work of
human hands. This is the Rtan (4,943 feet), at whose foot burst forth the hot
springs of Banya, the most frequented and efficacious of all Servia.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Morava and of its main tributary, the Bulgarian Morava,
divide Servia into two parts of unequal extent. The valley of the Morava forms
a natural highway between the Danube and the interior of Turkey, passing
through the frontier town of Alexinatz. A Roman road formerly led along it.
Krushevatz, the ancient capital of the Servian empire, occupies the centre of a
plain in the valley of the Servian Morava, not far above the defile of Stalaj,
where the two Moravas unite at the foot of a promontory crowned with ruins.
The remains of the palace of the Servian tsar are still shown there, and it is stated
that Krushevatz, at the height of Servian power, had a circumference of three
leagues. It is only a poor village now.</p>

<p>The wildest mountain masses of Servia rise between the two Moravas, their
culminating point being the Kopaonik (6,710 feet), which attains a greater height
than any other summit between the Save and the Balkans. A wide prospect
of incomparable beauty opens from its base and rocky summit, extending southwards
over plains and mountains to the pinnacles of the Skhar and the pyramidal
Dormitor. In itself, however, the Kopaonik is quite devoid of beauty, and where
its slopes have been deprived of the forests which once covered them, the bare
rocks of serpentine present a picture of utter desolation. Its valleys are far from
fertile, their inhabitants are sulky and poor, and many amongst them suffer from
goître.</p>

<p>The mountains which extend to the north of the Kopaonik, along both banks
of the Ibar, are for the most part still clothed with oaks, beeches, and conifers.
The broad valley of the Servian Morava, rivalling in fertility the plains of
Lombardy, penetrates into these mountain masses. But they rise again to the
north of that river, attaining a height of 3,622 feet in the mountain mass of
Rudnik. Cretaceous rocks predominate, frequently surmounted by granitic
peaks. The valleys are narrow and tortuous. This is the famous Sumadia, or
“forest region” of Servia, which during the rule of the Turks offered a safe
asylum to the persecuted rayas, and in the war of
independence became the <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
citadel of Servian liberty. The little town of Kraguyevatz, in one of its narrow
valleys, was chosen to be the seat of government, and it still retains a gun
foundry, supplied with coal from the basin of Chupriya. A secluded capital like
this may have suited a people constantly engaged in war, but when Servia entered
upon a career of progress the seat of government was removed to Belgrad.
This city—the Beográd, or “white town,” of the Servians, the <i>Singidunum</i> of the
Romans, and the <i>Alba Græca</i> of the Middle Ages—is delightfully situated upon a
hill near the confluence of the Danube and Save, and overlooks the swampy plains
of Syrmia. Belgrad, from its favourable geographical situation, has become a
place of much trade, and is likewise an important strategical position.</p>

<p>To the west of Belgrad we merely meet with hills, and with the fertile plains
watered by the Kolubara. It is only towards the south-west, on nearing the
Drina, that we again find ourselves in the midst of calcareous mountains, attaining
a height of 3,630 feet, and connected with spurs of the Kopaonik in the south.
This is one of the most picturesque portions of the country. Ruins of houses
and fortresses abound, amongst which those of Ushitza are the most extensive.
These fortresses have, however, failed to protect the country, and no portion of
Servia has more frequently been laid waste by ruthless invaders.</p>

<p>In former times Servia could boast of some of the most extensive oak forest
in Europe. “To kill a tree is to kill a Servian,” says an ancient proverb, dating
probably from the time when the forests afforded shelter to the oppressed rayas.
This proverb, unfortunately, is no longer acted upon. In many parts of the
country the forests have disappeared, and the naked rock obtrudes
itself as in <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
Dalmatia and Carniola. A peasant in need of a branch cuts down an entire tree,
and the herdsmen are not content to feed their bivouac fires with dry sticks, but
must needs have an oak. The greatest enemies of the forests, next to herdsmen,
are goats and hogs, the former browsing upon small trees and leaves, the latter
laying bare the roots. An old tree, thrown down by a tempest or sacrificed to
the woodman’s axe, is not replaced. Laws for the protection of the forests have
certainly been passed, but they are not enforced, and the wood required for fuel
has to be imported, in many instances, from Bosnia. The destruction of the
forests has naturally been attended by a deterioration of the climate. Mr. Edward
Brown, who travelled in Servia in the seventeenth century, tells us that the
Morava was then navigable for the greater part of its course; but at the
present time, owing to its irregularities, it is no longer available as a navigable
channel.</p>

<p>Servia, by despoiling the mountains of great forests, has got rid of the wild
animals which formerly infested them. Wolves, bears, wild boars, previously so
numerous, have almost disappeared, and those still met with occasionally are
supposed to come from the forests of Syrmia, crossing the frozen Save in winter.
The fauna and flora of Servia are gradually losing their original features. The
introduction of the domesticated animals and cultivated plants from Austria has
given to Servia a South German aspect. Nor does the climate much differ from
some parts of Southern Germany. Servia, though under the same latitude as
Tuscany, rejoices by no means in an Italian climate. The Dalmatian or Bosnian
mountain ramparts shut out the vivifying south-westerly winds, whilst the dry
and cold winds from the steppes of Russia have free access over the plains of
Wallachia. Strangers do not readily acclimatise themselves, owing to abrupt
changes of temperature.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn55" id="fnanch55">55</a></p>

<p>Servia includes within its limits but a small proportion of all the Servians of
Eastern Europe, but its inhabitants are probably not far wrong when they look
upon themselves as the purest representatives of their race. They are, as a rule,
tall, vigorous, with broad shoulders and an erect head. Their features are
marked, the nose straight and often aquiline, and the cheek-bones a trifle
prominent; the hair is abundant and rarely black, the eyes are piercing and
cold, and a well-cultivated moustache imparts a military air to the men. The
women, without being good-looking, have a noble presence, and their semi-oriental
costume is distinguished by an admirable harmony of colours. Even
in the towns, where French fashions carry the day, Servian ladies occasionally
wear the national dress, consisting of a red vest, a belt and chemisette embroidered
with pearls, strings of sequins, and a little fez stuck jauntily upon the
head.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the custom of the country requires that a Servian woman
should have an abundance of black hair and a dazzling white complexion. Paint,
dyes, and false tresses are universal in town and country. Even in the most
remote villages the peasant women dye their hair and paint
their cheeks, lips, <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span>
and eyebrows, frequently making use of poisonous substances injurious to health.
Rich country-people are, moreover, in the habit of making an exhibition of
their wealth by means of their clothes, which they overload with gold and silver
ornaments and gewgaws of every kind. In some districts brides and young
women wear a most extraordinary head-dress, consisting of an enormous crescent
of cardboard, to which are attached nosegays, leaves, peacock feathers, and
artificial roses with silver petals. This heavy head-dress may symbolize the
“burdens of matrimony;” it certainly exposes the wearer to great inconvenience.</p>

<p>The Servians are honourably distinguished amongst the people of the East
by the nobility of their character, their dignified bearing, and, in spite of recent
events, incontestable bravery. For centuries they resisted oppression, and, not­with­stand­ing
their isolation and poverty, they conquered their independence in the
beginning of this century. They are said to be idle and suspicious—qualities
which their former servitude accounts for—but at the same time honest and
truthful. It is difficult to cheat them, but they themselves never cheat. Equals
when under the dominion of the Turks, they are equals still. “There are no
nobles amongst us,” they say, “for we are all nobles.” In their clear and
sonorous language, so well suited to oratory, they fraternally address each other
in the second person singular. Even prisoners are looked upon as brothers, and
it is customary to permit a condemned criminal to visit his family on his giving
his word of honour to return to prison.</p>

<p>The ties of family and friendship are a great power in Servia. It frequently
happens that young men who have learnt to like each other take an oath of
fraternal friendship, in the manner of the brothers in arms of Scythia, and this
fraternity of heart is more sacred to them than that of blood. It is a remarkable
fact, and one which speaks favourably for the high moral tone of the Servians,
that their deep family affections and friendships do not lead to incessant acts
of retaliation and vengeance, as amongst their neighbours the Albanians. The
Servian is brave; he is always armed, but he is also peaceable, and does not
demand blood for blood. Still, like other men, he is not perfect. As an
agriculturist he follows the more obsolete routine. He is ignorant and superstitious.
The peasants firmly believe in vampires, sorcerers, and magicians, and,
in order to guard against their evil influences, they rub themselves with garlic on
Christmas-eve.</p>

<p>Land is held by families in common, as amongst the other Slavs of the South.
The ancient <i>zadruga</i>, such as it existed in the Middle Ages, is still preserved,
and has never been interfered with by Roman or German laws, as in Dalmatia or
Slavonia. On the contrary, the law of Servia protects this ancient form of tenure,
and, in cases of a disputed will, relatives by adoption take precedence of those by
blood. Servian patriots are desirous to see these ancient customs respected, and
the members of the <i>Skupshtina</i>, or parliament, have never attacked this common
proprietorship in the soil, for they look upon it as one of the surest safeguards
against pauperism. Servia offers the best opportunity
for studying agricultural <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span>
communities of this kind. Nowhere else are the features of family life equally
delightful. The heavy day’s work is followed by an evening devoted to pleasure.
The children gather round their parents to listen to the warlike legends of old,
or the young men sing, accompanying themselves upon the <i>guzla</i>. All those
belonging to the association are looked upon as members of the family. The
<i>staryeshina</i>, or head of the community, has charge of the education of the
children, whom he is required to bring up as “good and honest citizens, useful
to their fatherland.” Yet, in spite of all these advantages, the <i>zadrugas</i> decrease
from year to year. The demands of commerce and industry interfere with their
accustomed routine, and they will hardly survive much longer in their present
form.</p>

<p>A great portion of Eastern Servia has been occupied by Wallachians, who
were invited to the country after the war of independence, when vast districts
had been depopulated. These new settlers, being more prolific than their
neighbours, gradually gain upon the Servians, and already some of their colonies
are met with on the western bank of the Morava. Many Servian villages have
become Wallachian as far as language can make them so. It is a strange fact
that these Rumanian colonists should prosper in Servia, whilst Servian colonists
from Hungary and Slavonia do not.</p>

<p>Zinzares, or Southern Wallachians, are met with in most towns, where they
work as masons, carpenters, and bricklayers.</p>

<p>Bulgarians have settled in the valleys of the Timok and Morava, in the south-east.
They are highly esteemed for their industry, and quickly assimilate with
the Servians. Near Alexinatz there is a small colony of Albanians, whilst
Tsigani, or gipsies, are met with in all parts of the country. They profess to
be Christians, and one of their principal occupations is the manufacture of bricks.
The Spanish Jews, so numerous formerly at Belgrad, have most of them retired to
Semlin, their places being filled by German and Hungarian Jews.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn56" id="fnanch56">56</a></p>

<p>Taken as a whole, Servia was a prosperous country before the recent war.
The population has increased rapidly since the declaration of independence, but
is not nearly as dense yet as in the neighbouring plains of Hungary or Wallachia.
Scarcely one-eighth of the area is under cultivation, and agricultural operations
are for the most part carried on in the rudest manner. Excepting in the most
fertile valleys, such as that of the Lower Timok, the fields are allowed to lie
fallow every second year. The exports of Servia clearly exhibit the rudimentary
condition of its agriculture, for they consist principally of lean pigs, which find
their way in thousands to the markets of Germany, and of cattle. The peasant
of Servia derives most of his revenue from the sale of these animals. Within the
last few years he has also exported some wheat to the markets of Western Europe. If
it were not for the Bulgarian labourers who annually flock to the country in search
of field-work, Servia would not produce sufficient corn
for its own consumption.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn57" id="fnanch57">57</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span></p>

<p>Industry throughout the country is still in its infancy. The Servian despises
all manual labour excepting agriculture, and it is for this reason he looks down
upon the German mechanics in the towns. Young men of the least education
aspire to government employment, and the bureaucratic plague, which has
wrought such injury in the neighbouring Austro-Hungarian empire, is thus being
developed. There are, however, others who have studied at foreign universities,
and who devote their energies to the spread of education at home. The progress
made in this respect within the last few years has been enormous. In 1839 the
sovereign of the country could neither read nor write, whilst, at the present time,
Servia, with its numerous schools and colleges, is becoming the intellectual centre
of the Balkan peninsula.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn58" id="fnanch58">58</a></p>

<p>The Servians have used their best efforts to remove from their country
everything reminding them of the ancient dominion of the Mussulman, and they
have nearly accomplished this. The Belgrad of the Turks has been converted
by them into a Western city, like Vienna or Buda-Pest; palaces in European
style have arisen in the place of mosques and minarets; magnificent boulevards
intersect the old quarters of the town; and the esplanade, where the Turks
exposed the heads of their victims stuck on poles, has been converted into a
park. Shabatz, on the Save, has become a “little Paris;” Semendria
(Smederevo), on the Danube, which gave the signal of rebellion in 1806, has
arisen like a phœnix from its ashes; whilst Posharevatz, known as Passarovitz
in the history of treaties, has likewise been transformed. Progress is slower in
the interior, but good roads now extend to the most remote corners of the
country.</p>

<p>Servia is an hereditary constitutional monarchy. The Prince, or <i>Kniaz</i>,
governs with the aid of responsible ministers and of a senate; he promulgates
the laws, appoints all public functionaries, commands the army, and signs the
treaties. He rejoices in a civil list of £20,000. His successor, in the case of
there being no male heir, is to be elected by universal suffrage. The <i>Skupshtina</i>,
or national parliament, traces back its origin to the earliest times of a Servian
monarchy. It numbers 134 members, of whom one-fourth are nominated by the
Prince, and the remainder elected by all male taxpayers. This parliament
exercises legislative functions conjointly with the Prince. In addition to it there
exist rural parliaments in each of the 1,063 <i>obshtinas</i>, or parishes, and these enjoy
extended rights of local self-government. The constitution provides for the
election of a <i>Skupshtina</i> of 536 members by universal suffrage, should extraordinary
events make such a meeting desirable. The affairs of the country have
hitherto been managed satisfactorily. A revenue of £554,000 sufficed for the
requirements of the State, and up to the outbreak of the war there existed no
public debt.</p>

<p>Religious liberty exists, but the Greek Church is declared to be that of the
State. It has been independent of the Patriarch of
Constantinople since 1376, and <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
is governed by a synod consisting of the Archbishop of Belgrad and the Bishops
of Ushitza, Negotin, and Shabatz. The former is appointed by the Prince. The
high dignitaries of the Church are in receipt of salaries, but ordinary priests are
dependent upon fees and gifts. The monasteries have been suppressed by a recent
decision of the <i>Skupshtina</i>, and their revenues are to be devoted to educational
purposes.</p>

<p>The military forces of the country consist of a standing army of about 4,000
men, and of a militia including all men capable of bearing arms up to fifty years
of age. The first ban of this militia is called out annually for training, the second
ban only in case of war. Servia is thus able to place an army of 150,000 men in
the field, but the efficiency of these badly trained troops leaves much to be desired,
as has been shown by recent events.</p>

<p>The country is divided into seventeen <i>okrushias</i>, or districts, viz. Alexinatz,
Belgrad, Chachak, Chupriya, Knyashevatz, Kraguyevatz, Kraina (capital, Negotin),
Krushevatz, Podrinye (Loznitza), Posharevatz, Rudnik (Milanovitz), Shabatz,
Smederevo, Tserna-Reka (Zaichar), Ushitza, Valyevo, and Yagodina. The only
towns of importance are Belgrad (27,000 inhabitants), Posharevatz (7,000 inhabitants),
Shabatz (6,700 inhabitants), and Kraguyevatz (6,000 inhabitants).</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 title="Montenegro."><span
 class="smcap">M<b>ONTENEGRO.</b></span></h3></div>

<p class="pfirst">The name Montenegro is a translation of the Servian Tsrnagora, or “black
mountains.” It is a curious designation for a country of white or greyish
calcareous mountains, whose colour even strikes the voyager on the Adriatic.
The name, according to some, is to be taken figuratively, and is to be understood
as designating a country of “bad” or “black” men; others are of opinion that
it refers to ancient pine forests which have now disappeared.</p>

<p>The Turks have never succeeded in subjugating the Montenegrins, who found
safety in their mountain fastnesses. Occasionally the Montenegrins placed
themselves under the protection of a foreign power, such as that of Venice, but
they never acknowledged the Sultan as their sovereign. The mountains, however,
to which they owe their independence, are at the same time their weakness,
for they isolate them from the rest of the world. A high range of mountains,
as well as a strip of Turkish territory, separates them from their Servian kinsmen;
another range, held by the Austrians, cuts them off from the Gulf of Cattaro and
the Adriatic Sea. The small Lake of Scutari (Skodra) is their sea; the Zeta and
Moracha, which feed it, are their national rivers. If the Montenegrins were
permitted to descend into the plains without sacrificing their independence, the
arid plateaux now inhabited by them would soon be deserted by all but
shepherds.</p>

<p>The eastern portion of Montenegro, which is known as the Berda, and drained
by the Moracha and its tributaries, is comparatively of easy access. The mighty
dolomitic pyramids of the Dormitor (8,550 feet) command its
valleys in the <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span>
north, whilst the rounded heights of Kom (9,000 feet) bound it on the east.
The Berda differs in no respect from most other mountain countries. It is only
in the western portion of the country, in Montenegro proper, that we meet with
features altogether distinct. We there find ourselves in a labyrinth of cavities,
valleys, and depressions, separated by craggy calcareous ridges, abounding in
narrow fissures, the hiding-places of adders. Only the mountaineers are able to
find their way in this inextricable labyrinth. “When God created the world,”
they tell you laughing, “he held in his hand a sack full of mountains. Right
above Montenegro the sack burst, and hence the fearful chaos of rocks which you
see before you.”</p>

<p>Seen from an immense height, Montenegro resembles a vast honeycomb with
thousands of cells, and this appearance is due to aqueous agencies. The water at
one spot has scooped out wide valleys, whilst elsewhere its long-continued action
has merely succeeded in producing narrow <i>rudinas</i>, or sink-holes. After heavy rains
the waters accumulate into lakes, covering fields and pastures, but ordinarily they
run off rapidly through sink-holes concealed by brambles, only to reappear again
near the seashore as abundant springs of bluish water. The Zeta, the principal
river of Montenegro, is fed by rivulets which are swallowed up in
the valley of <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
Niksich to the north, and find their way to it through subterranean channels.
Similar phenomena have already been noticed in connection with Bosnia (p. <a
 href="#p127" title="go to p. 127">127</a>).
The capital of Montenegro, Tsetinye (Cetinje), lies in the very midst of the
mountains, in the centre of an ancient lake basin. Formerly it was accessible
only by a most difficult mountain path, for the Montenegrins took care not to
construct roads, which would open their country to the guns of their enemies.
The requirements of commerce, however, have recently induced them to connect
it with Cattaro by means of a carriage road.</p>

<p>The Montenegrins are the kinsmen of the Servians of the Danube, but their
life of almost incessant warfare, the elevation and sterility of their country, as
well as the vicinity of the Albanians, have developed special features amongst
them. The quiet life of the plains is unknown to the Montenegrin; he is violent,
and ready at all times to take up arms; in his belt he carries a whole arsenal
of pistols and knives, and even when working in the fields he has a carbine by
his side. Until recently the price of blood was still enacted, and a scratch even
had to be paid for. This blood vengeance was transmitted from generation to
generation, until the number of victims was equal on both sides, or a monetary
compensation, usually fixed at ten sequins, had been accepted. Cases of hereditary
vengeance are rare now, but the ancient “custom” could be suppressed only by
a law of terrible severity, which punishes murderers, traitors, rebels, thieves twice
convicted, incendiaries, and scoffers at religion alike with death. Compared with
the Servian of the Danube, the Montenegrin is a barbarian. Nor is his personal
appearance equally prepossessing. The women, however, have regular features,
and, though less dignified in their carriage than their kinswomen of Servia, they
possess, as a rule, more grace and elasticity of movement. They are very
prolific, and if a family increases too rapidly it is customary for a friend to
adopt one or more of the children.</p>

<p>Up to the invasion of the Osmanli the upper valleys of Montenegro were the
home merely of herdsmen and brigands. But the inhabitants of the lower valleys
were forced to retire to these austere heights in order to escape slavery. They
cultivated the soil, bred cattle and sheep, and sometimes robbed their neighbours.
But the sterile soil yielded only a scanty harvest, and famines were by no means
unfrequent. Bosnian Uskoches, who fled to the mountains in order to escape
Mussulman oppression, only added to the misery by reducing to a minimum the
share of cultivable soil which fell to the lot of each family. The pastures are
still held in common, in accordance with the ancient customs of the Servians.
According to a recent census, Montenegro is said to have a population of nearly
200,000 souls. This may be an exaggeration, but the country is not even able
to support 120,000 inhabitants without drawing supplies from beyond, and the
armed incursions into neighbouring districts might thus be excused as an “economical
necessity.” Death from hunger or on the field of battle was often the only
alternative. The Montenegrin always prefers the latter, for he does not fear
death, and “May you never die in bed&#x202f;!” is a wish universally expressed at the
cradle of a new-born infant. If a man is unfortunate enough to
die of disease, <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
or from old age, his friends excuse him euphemistically by charging the “Old
Murderer” with his death.</p>

<p>The warlike incursions of former days have ceased now, for the boundaries
of Montenegro have been defined by an international commission, and the
mountaineers have established friendly relations with their neighbours, from
whom they are able now to purchase what they require. In summer they permit
the inhabitants of the coast to take their cattle into the hills, whilst in winter
they themselves descend to the seaboard, where they are sure now of a friendly
reception.</p>

<p>The Montenegrins have always been anxious to possess a port on the Adriatic,
which would enable them to import freely, and without the intervention of the
merchants of Cattaro, the powder, salt, and other articles they require, and to
export their own produce. Their commerce, even now, is of some importance.
They export smoked mutton, sheep and goats, skins, tallow, salt fish, cheese,
honey, sumach, insect powder, &amp;c., of an estimated value of £40,000 annually.</p>

<p>The Montenegrins, like their neighbours the Albanians, frequently leave their
country for a time in order to seek work in the great cities of the East. Thousands
of them are to be met in Constantinople, where they manage to live
on friendly terms with the Turks, their “hereditary enemies.” They are even to
be found in Egypt.</p>

<p>The Tsigani are the only strangers met with in the country. They resemble
the Servians in language, dress, religion, and customs, and only differ from them
by working at a useful trade, that of smiths. Their industry, however, causes
them to be objects of disdain, and they are not permitted to intermarry with
Servians.</p>

<p>The government of Montenegro is a curious mixture of democratic, feudal, and
despotic institutions. The citizens fancy that they are equals, but they are not,
for certain families exercise a powerful influence. The sovereign, who appropriates
about half the revenue of the country, and receives 8,000 ducats annually
from Russia in addition, appoints the members of the Senate, or <i>Sovyet</i>. The
<i>Skupshtina</i> includes the <i>glavars</i>, or chiefs, of the thirty-nine tribes (<i>plemena</i>), but
has hitherto limited itself to applauding the “speech from the throne.” There
is a body-guard of a hundred men, and the whole of the male population is
bound to take the field under the leadership of Serdars. The country is divided
into eight <i>nahiés</i>, or districts, of which four (Bielopavlichka, Uskochka, Morachka,
and Vasoyevichka, with the country of the Kuchi), constitute the Berda, and
four (Katunska, Liesanska, Riechka, and Tsermnichka) belong to Montenegro
proper. Each of these districts is placed under a <i>kniaz</i>. The families and
associations of families (<i>brastvos</i>) are governed by <i>hospodars</i> and <i>starshinas</i>,
dependent upon the tribal chiefs, or <i>glavars</i>.</p>

limits of the Italian peninsula have been most distinctly traced
by nature. The Alps, which bound it in the north, from the
promontories of Liguria to the mountainous peninsula of Istria,
present themselves like a huge wall, the only breaches in which
are formed by passes situated high up in the zones of pines,
pastures, or eternal snows. Italy, like its two sister peninsulas of Southern
Europe, thus constitutes a world of its own, destined by nature to become the
theatre of a special evolution of humanity. Its delightful climate, beauteous
skies, and fertile fields distinguish it in a marked manner from the countries
lying beyond the Alps; and an inhabitant of the latter who descends the sunny
southern slope of this dividing range cannot fail to perceive that everything
around him has changed, and that he has entered a “new world.”</p>

<p>The protecting barrier of the Alps and the sea which bounds it have
imparted to Italy a distinct individuality. All its countries, from the plains of
Lombardy to the shores of Sicily, resemble each other in certain respects. There
is a sort of family likeness about them; but still what
delightful contrasts, what <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
picturesque variety, do we not meet with&#x202f;! Most of these contrasts are due to
the Apennines, which branch off from the southern extremity of the French Alps.
At first they run close to the seashore, like a huge wall supported at intervals
by powerful buttresses; subsequently they traverse the whole of the peninsula.
At times they are reduced to a narrow ridge, at others they spread out into vast
masses, rising in plateaux or ramifying into chains and promontories. River
valleys and plains intersect them in all directions; lakes and filled-up lake basins
are spread out at the foot of their cliffs; and numerous volcanoes, rising above the
general level, contrast, by their regular form, with the rugged declivities of
the Apennines. The sea, following these sinuosities in the relief of the ground,
forms a series of bays, arranged with a certain degree of symmetry. In the
north these bays do not much encroach upon the land, but in the south they
penetrate deeply, and almost form veritable gulfs. There once existed an Italy
of granitic rocks, but it exists no longer, for the rocks of the Apennines and of
the plains teach us that the Italy of the present is of recent origin, and that the
many islands of which it consisted formerly were united into a single peninsula
as recently as the Eocene epoch.</p>

<p>Italy, compared with Greece, exhibits much sobriety in its configuration.
Its mountains are arranged in more regular ridges, its coasts are less indented, its
small archipelagos bear no comparison with the Cyclades, and its three great
dependent islands, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, are regular in their contours.
Indeed, its contours mark its intermediate position between joyous Greece and
severe Iberia. Thus there exists a correspondence between geographical position
and contours.</p>

<p>Italy, as a whole, contrasts in a remarkable manner with the Balkan peninsula.
The former faces the Ægean, and looks towards the east, whilst in the
truly peninsular portion of Italy, to the south of the plains of Lombardy, the
westerly slopes offer most life. Secure harbours are most numerous on the shores
of the Tyrrhenian, and the largest and most fertile plains slope down towards
that sea. It results from this that the western slopes of the Apennines have
given birth to the most enterprising and intelligent populations, who have taken
the lead in the political history of their country. The west represents the light,
whilst the east, bounded as it is by the Adriatic, an inland sea almost, a simple
gulf, represents the night. True, the plains of Apulia, though on the east, are
wealthier and more populous than the mountain regions of Calabria, but the
vicinity of Sicily, nevertheless, even there insures the preponderance of the
western littoral. Whilst Greece was in the height of her glory, whilst every
initiative went forth from Athens, the cities of Asia Minor, and the islands of the
Ægean, those republics which looked towards the east, such as Tarentum, Locri,
Sybaris, Syracuse, and Catania, enjoyed a pre-eminence over the cities on the
western littoral. The physical configuration of Italy thus facilitated the march
of civilisation from the south-east to the north-west, from Ionia to Gaul. The
Gulf of Taranto and the eastern coasts of Greater Greece and Sicily were freely
exposed to Hellenic influences, whilst further north the peninsula
faces about to <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
the west as it were. There can be no doubt that these features greatly facilitated
the expansion of ideas in the direction of Western Europe, and that if it had been
otherwise civilisation would have taken another direction.</p>

<p>For nearly two thousand years, from the fall of Carthage to the discovery
of America, Italy remained the centre of the civilised world. It maintained its
hegemony either by conquest and organization, as in the case of the “Eternal
City,” or by the power of its genius, the relative liberty of its institutions, its
sciences, arts, and commerce, as in the times of Florence, Genoa, and Venice.
Two of the greatest events in history, the political unification of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
world under the laws of Rome, and at a later epoch the regeneration
of the human mind, so appropriately termed “Renaissance,” originated in
Italy. It behoves us, therefore, to inquire into the geographical conditions
which may account for this preponderance during these two ages in the life of
mankind.</p>

<p>Mommsen and others have pointed out the favourable position of Rome as an
emporium. From the very first that city became the commercial centre of the
neighbouring populations. Built in the centre of a circus of hills, and on the
banks of a navigable river, not far from the sea, it likewise possessed the advantage
of lying on the frontiers of three nations—Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans.
When Rome had conquered the neighbouring territories it undoubtedly rose into
importance as a place of commerce. This local traffic, however, would never have
converted Rome into a great city. Its position is not to be compared with that
of places like Alexandria, Constantinople, or Bombay, upon which the world’s
commerce converges as a matter of course. On the contrary, its situation hardly
favours commerce. The Apennines, which environ the territory of Rome in a
huge semicircle, constituted a formidable obstacle until quite recently, and were
avoided by merchants; the sea near Rome is treacherous, and even the small galleys
of the ancients could not enter the inefficient harbour at Ostia without risk.</p>

<p>The power of Rome, therefore, depended but in a small measure upon commercial
advantages resulting from geographical position. It is its central
position to which that city is mainly indebted for its greatness, and which
enabled it to weld the whole of the ancient world into a political whole. Three
concentric circles drawn around the city correspond with as many phases in its
development. During their first struggles for existence the Romans enjoyed
the advantage of occupying a basin of limited extent, shielded on all sides by
mountains. When Rome had exterminated the inhabitants of these mountains
the remainder of Italy naturally gravitated towards her. The plains of Cis-and
Transpadana in the north presented no obstacles, whilst the resistance of the
uncivilised tribes of the mountain regions of the south was soon broken, for they
found no support amongst the Greek colonies scattered along an extensive coast.
Nor were the populations of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica sufficiently united to
offer an effective resistance to the organized forces of the Romans, who were thus
able to extend their power over all the countries comprehended within the second
concentric circle referred to. <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span></p>

<p>It happened that the plains of Northern Italy and Sicily were both rich
granaries, which enabled the Romans to push forward their conquests. The whole
world of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean gravitated towards Rome and Italy: Illyria, Greece,
and Egypt in the east, Libya and Mauritania in the south, Iberia in the west,
Gaul in the north-west, and the transalpine countries in the north.</p>

<p>Rome maintained her power and influence as long as the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
constituted the world; but, in proportion as the borders of the known world were
enlarged, so did Rome lose the advantages which a central position had conferred
upon her. Even during the latter days of the Roman empire Milan and Ravenna
usurped the position once held by Rome, and the latter became the capital of
the Ostrogothic kingdom, and subsequently the seat of the Byzantine exarchs.
Rome, the city of the Cæsars, had fallen for evermore&#x202f;! True, the emperors were
succeeded by the popes, but the real masters of the “Holy Roman Empire”
resided beyond the Alps, and only came to Italy to have their power consecrated.
Even in Italy itself Rome ceased to be the leading town, its place being taken by
Pavia, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Venice, Bologna, and even Turin.</p>

<p>The unity of Italy has been realised in the course of this century, and,
excepting a few Alpine valleys, its political boundaries coincide with its natural
ones. It may surprise us that this unity should not have been established long
ago, but the geographical configuration of Italy readily lends
itself to the <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
establishment of small states. Its islands, its mountain-bound plains, and coast
districts, shut off from the interior of the country by abrupt mountains, formed as
many centres where populations of diverse origin were able to lead a life independently
of their neighbours. Now and then the whole of Italy acknowledged
a single master, but it only did so on compulsion. That spirit of nationality
which has given birth to a united Italy only animated very few citizens of the
mediæval republics. They might unite to resist a common danger, but no sooner
was it past than they went their separate ways, or, still worse, fought amongst
themselves about some trifle.</p>

<p>Cola di Rienzi, the tribune of Rome, appealed to the cities of Italy in the
middle of the fourteenth century; he adjured them to “throw off the yoke of the
tyrant, and to form a holy national brotherhood, whose object should be the
liberation of Rome and the whole of Italy.” His messengers, carrying a silver
wand, went to every city with greetings of amity, and asked that deputies should
be sent to the future parliament of the Eternal City. Rienzi, full of the
memories of the past, declared that Rome had not ceased to be the “mistress of
the world,” and had a natural right to govern all nations. It was his aim to
resuscitate the past, not to evoke a new life, and his work disappeared like a
dream. Florence and Venice, the most active cities of that period, looked upon
him as a visionary. “Siamo Veneziani, poi Cristiani,” said the proud citizens
of Venice in the fifteenth century. They, whose sons fought so valiantly for
Italian independence, never thought of calling themselves Italians. At the same
time we must bear in mind that the impulse which has made Italy one did not
originate with the masses, for there are still millions of Sicilians, Sardinians,
Calabrians, and even Lombards who do not appreciate the vast changes which
have taken place.</p>

<p>If Italy no longer remains a “geographical expression,” it is owing in a
large measure to frequent foreign invasions. Spaniards, French, and Germans
in turn have seized the fertile plains of Italy, and their hard oppression has
taught the Italians to look upon each other as brothers. The Alps might be
supposed to offer an effective protection against such invasions, but they do not.
They are steepest on the Italian side, whilst their exterior slopes, towards France,
Switzerland, and German Austria, are comparatively gentle. Invaders, tempted
by the delightful climate and the wealth of Italy, were able to reach easily
the Alpine passes, whence they rushed down upon the plains; and thus the
“barrier of the Alps” is a barrier only to the Italians, and has always been
respected by them, excepting during the Roman empire. Nor is there any reason
why they should cross it, for there is no country beyond equal to their own.
French, Swiss, and Germans, on the other hand, have always looked upon Italy
as a sort of paradise. It was the country of their dreams; they yielded frequently
to their desire to possess it, and dyed its coveted plains with blood.</p>

<p>Italy, exposed as it is to attacks from beyond, and no longer situated in the
centre of the known world, has definitively lost its <i>primato</i>, or foremost place
amongst nations, which some of its sons, carried away by
an exclusive patriotism, <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span>
would restore to it. But though no longer the most powerful nation, and
eclipsed in industry, commerce, and even literature and science, it still remains
unrivalled in its treasures of art. There is no other country in the world
which can boast of an equal number of cities remarkable on account of their
buildings, statues, paintings, and decorations of every kind. There are provinces
where every village, every group of houses even, delights the eye either by a
fresco painting or a work of the sculptor’s chisel, a bold staircase or picturesque
balcony. The instinct for art has passed into the blood of the people, and we
need not wonder if an Italian peasant builds his house and plants his trees so as
to bring them into harmony with the surrounding landscape. This constitutes the
greatest charm of Italy; everywhere art goes hand in hand with nature. How
many artists are there not in Lombardy, Venetia, or Tuscany who would have
become famous in any other country, but whose names will never be remembered,
in consequence of their overwhelming numbers, or because their lot was
cast in some remote village&#x202f;!</p>

<p>Italy owes the rank it has held for more than two thousand years not
merely to its monuments and works of art, which attract students from the
extremities of the earth, but also to its historical associations. In a country which
has been inhabited for centuries by a civilised people there cannot be a town
the origin of which is not lost in the darkness of tradition. The modern cities
have replaced the Roman towns, and these latter rose upon the ruins of some
Greek, Etruscan, or Gallic settlement. Every fortress, every country house,
marks the site of some ancient citadel, or of the villa of a Roman patrician;
churches have replaced the ancient temples, and though the religious rites have
changed, the altars of gods and saints arise anew in the spots consecrated of old.
An examination of these relics of all ages is full of interest, and only the most
obtuse can resist the influence of the historical reminiscences which surround him.</p>

<p>Italy, after a long period of decay and foreign domination, has again taken its
place amongst the foremost modern nations. The aspect of the peninsula has
undergone many changes since it received the name of Vitalia, or Italia, from the
herds of cattle which roamed over it. Its well-cultivated plains, carefully tended
gardens, and busy cities entitle it now to some other appellation. The passes of
the Alps and its central position give Italy the command of all the routes which
converge from France, Germany, and Austria upon the Gulfs of Genoa and
Venice. Its quarries, sulphur and iron mines, its wines and agricultural produce
of every description, and its industry afford ever-growing resources. Its men of
learning and inventors may fairly claim to be on a level with those of other
countries. The population increases rapidly. It is not only more dense than in
France, but also sends a considerable contingent of emigrants to the solitudes of
Southern America.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn60" id="fnanch60">60</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">The
valley of the Po is frequently spoken of as Upper Italy, because it occupies
the northern portion of the peninsula, but might more appropriately be termed
the Italian Netherlands, for its elevation is less than that of any other group of
provinces. It is a river valley now, but during the Pliocene epoch it still formed
a gulf of the sea. This gulf was gradually filled up by the alluvium brought
down by the rivers, and upheaved by subterranean forces above the surface of the
waters, the erosive action of the mountain torrents continuing all the while;
and thus, in the course of ages, the basin of the Po assumed its gentle and
regular slope towards the sea. As long as the waters of the Adriatic penetrated
the valleys between Monte Rosa and Monte Viso, Italy was
attached to the Alps <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
of continental Europe only by a narrow neck of land formed by the Ligurian
Apennines.</p>

<p>No other region of Europe can rival the valley of the Po as regards the
magnificence of its distant prospects. The Apennines in the south raise their
heads above the region of forests, their rocks, woods, and pasturages contrasting
with the uniform plain spread out along their foot; whilst the snow-clad Alps
rise in all their sublimity from the Col di Tenda in the west to the passes of Istria
in the east. The isolated pyramid of Monte Viso (thus called from the beautiful
prospect which may be obtained from its summit) looks down upon the fields of
Saluzzo, and the small lakes in its pasturing region feed a roaring rivulet which
subsequently assumes the name of Po. Enormous buttresses to the north-west of
Turin support the ice-clad Grand Paradis, near which peeps out the Grivola,
perhaps the most charming, the most gracefully chiselled of all Alpine peaks.
Right in the bend of the Alpine chain rises the dome of Mont Blanc, like an
island above a sea of mountains. Monte Rosa, crowned with a seven-pointed
diadem, pushes its spurs far into Italy. Then come the Splügen, the Ortler, the
Adamello, the Marmolade, and many another summit distinguished for some
special beauty. When from the top of the dome of Milan we behold spread
out around us this magnificent amphitheatre of mountains rising above the
verdant plain, we may well rejoice that we should have lived to contemplate so
grand a scene.</p>

<p>Geographically the Alps belong to the countries which surround Italy. From
the south we seize at a glance the entire slope of the mountains, from the vineyards
and plantations of mulberry-trees to the forests of beech and larch, the
pastures, the naked rocks, and the dazzling fields of ice. But the cultivator only
ventured into this difficult region when forced by poverty. The features of the
northern slope are quite different. There the land rises gradually, and the valleys
are less fertile, but the inhabitants can easily reach the heads of the passes,
whence they look down upon the inviting plains of Italy. It is this structure of
the Alps which explains the preponderance of the Germanic and Gallic elements
throughout their extent, and whilst Italian is spoken only in a few isolated
localities beyond this mountain barrier, the French and German elements are
largely represented on their inner slopes.</p>

<p>Italy can only claim a few Alpine mountain masses within the basin of the
Po, the Adige, and the rivers of Venetia. The most important of these, alike on
account of its height, its glaciers, and springs, is the Grand Paradis, which rears
its head to the south of the Dora Baltea, between the masses of Mont Blanc and
the plains of Piemont. An Englishman, Mr. Mathews, may claim to be the first
discoverer of this mountain giant, which even on the Sardinian staff map,
published only recently, is confounded with Mont Iseran, a far less noble summit
twenty-five miles to the west of it.</p>

<p>None of the other Alpine summits on Italian territory can compare in height
with the Grand Paradis, for though the Italian language extends in numerous
instances to the central chain of the Alps, the political boundaries of
Italy do not. <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
Switzerland holds possession of the valley of the Upper Ticino, whilst Austria still
possesses the Upper Adige. The only rivers rising on the southern slope of the
Alps, and belonging in their entirety, or nearly so, to Italy, are the Tagliamento
and the Piave. In consequence of this violation of the natural frontiers there
are many snow-clad Alpine summits which, though geographically belonging to
Italy, are situated on the frontiers of the present kingdom, or even within
Swiss or Austrian territory. Amongst these are the giant summits of the Ortler,
the Marmolade, and the precipitous Cimon della Pala. The Monte della Disgrazia,
however, to the south of the Bernina, is an Italian mountain; such is also, for the
greater part, the mountain mass of the Camonica, bounded on the north by the
Pass of Tonale, which plays so prominent a part in legendary history, and is
commanded by the Adamo, or Adamello, whose glacier streams creep down to
the Upper Adige. Farther to the east, in the valley of the Piave, the obelisk
surmounting the huge pyramid of the Antelao pierces the line of perennial snow,
and there are other peaks scarcely inferior to it in height.</p>

<p>Most of the Alpine groups lying within Italy and between the
main chain and <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
the plains do not exceed the Apennines in height, and only a few amongst them
are covered with perennial snow. But the prospects which may be enjoyed from
them are all the more charming for this reason, for we find ourselves between two
zones, with cultivated valleys, towns, and villages at our feet, and a panorama of
bare and snowy summits bounding the view to the north. Several of these
mountains deservedly attract large numbers of tourists. Favourites amongst
them are the hills rising above the blue lakes of Lombardy, such as the Motterone
on Lago Maggiore, the pyramidal Generoso rising in the midst of verdant fields
on the Lake of Lugano, the superb hills between the two arms of the Lake of
Como and the fertile plains of the Brianza, and Monte Baldo, advancing its
buttresses like lions’ claws into the waters of the Lake of Garda. The mountains
of the Val Tellina, or the Orobia range, to the south of the valley of the Upper
Adda, being remote from towns and customary highways, are less frequently
visited than they deserve. Standing at their foot, we may almost fancy being in
the Pyrenees. As to the dolomites, on the frontiers of Venetia and the Tyrol,
they are unique. Their fantastically shaped rocks, delicately tinted with pink
and other colours, contrast marvellously with the green of beeches and firs, or
the blue waters of the lakes. Richthofen and others look upon these isolated
mountain masses as ancient coral islands, or <i>atolls</i>, upheaved to a height varying
between 6,500 and 10,400 feet; and, whatever their geological origin may be,
they certainly contribute much towards the beauty of the Alpine regions.</p>

<p>If we descend the Italian slope of the Alps, we pass gradually from the more
ancient to the most recent geological formation, until we finally reach the alluvial
plain. Metamorphic rocks, <i>verrucano</i>, dolomites, and other rocks overlie the
granites, the gneiss, and the schists of the more elevated mountain masses. These
are succeeded by beds of Triassic and Jurassic age. Lower still
we meet with <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
terraces and hills composed of tertiary marls, clays, and conglomerates. Monte
Bolca, so famous amongst geologists on account of its fossils, belongs to this
formation.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn62" id="fnanch62">62</a> The whole of the plain of Lombardy and Piemont, with the
exception of the isolated hillocks rising in it, and a few marine deposits near its
margin, consists of débris brought down by the rivers. The depth of this accumulation
is not yet known, for hitherto no borings have pierced it; but if we
suppose the slopes of the Alps and the Apennines to continue uniformly, it would
amount to no less than 4,130 feet. The two diagrams (Fig. 53) are intended to
illustrate this feature. In the upper of these the heights are exaggerated tenfold;
in the lower both the horizontal and the vertical scales are the same. A
glance at this diagram reveals the astounding fact that the volume of this débris
almost equals that of the existing mountain systems.</p>

<p>The vast plain stretching from the Adriatic to the foot of the Monte Rosa and
the Viso may boast of its peninsulas, its islands, and even its archipelagos, as if
it were a sea. The tertiary hills of Northern Monferrato, to the east of Turin,
attain a height of 1,600 to 2,000 feet, and the valley of the Tanaro completely
separates them from the Ligurian Alps and the Apennines. Even at the very
foot of the Alps, as at Cavour and elsewhere, isolated granitic or porphyritic
pyramids and domes rise in the midst of the plain sloping down towards the Po.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn63" id="fnanch63">63</a>
The hump-backed Bosco Montello, to the south of the Piave, is another isolated
hill; and on the banks of the Po may be seen a hillock of pebbles and marine
sands, abounding in fossils, which bears the village of San Colombano and its
vineyards. Several volcanic peaks, surrounded by cretaceous formations, rise in
the midst of the plains to the east of the Lake of Garda. The craters of the
Berici, near Vicenza, and of the Euganean Hills, near
Padua, have not vomited <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
flames within the historical epoch, but the hot and the gas springs which issue
from clefts in the trachytic and basaltic rocks prove sufficiently that volcanic
forces are not yet quite extinct in that part of Italy. Earthquakes occur frequently
in the neighbouring Alps, and particularly near Belluno and Bassano.</p>

<p>A similar volcanic zone extends along the northern slope of the Apennines,
which bound the valley of the Po on the south. Hydrogen gas escapes from
fissures in the rocks to the south of Modena and Bologna, and is utilised in
several instances in the manufacture of lime, and for other purposes. These gas
springs of Pietra Mala, Porretta, and Barigazzo were known by the ancients and
during the Middle Ages as “fiery springs,” and they illuminated the path of the
traveller overtaken by the night. Lower down the slope, almost on the verge of
the plains, we meet with a line of mud volcanoes, or <i>bombi</i>, the most famous of
which are those of Sassuolo, near Modena. The largest of these, that of Mirano,
has no less than forty craters. The ancient gulf of the sea, now converted into
a plain, is thus skirted by volcanic cones, mud volcanoes, hot springs, and deposits
of sulphur. As high up as Piemont, and notably at Acqui, we meet with hot
springs, attesting that volcanic activity is not yet altogether extinct.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Alps and the plains extending along their foot were filled,
in a former geological epoch, with huge glaciers, descending from what was
anciently the immense glacial region of Central Europe. There is not a valley
between that of the Tanaro in the west, and that of the Isonzo descending from the
mountains of Carinthia, but contains accumulations of débris
carried down by the <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
glaciers, and now covered with vegetation. Most of these ancient glaciers
exceeded those of the Monte Rosa and the Finsteraarhorn in extent, and several
of them rivalled the existing glaciers of the Himalaya. If we would gain a
notion of what the Alps were like during this glacial epoch, we must go to Greenland
or to the Antarctic regions.</p>

<p>One of the smallest of these ice streams, that which descended from the
mountains of Tenda in the direction of Cuneo, had a length of thirty miles.
That which brought down the ice of Mont Genèvre, Mont Tabor, and Mont Cenis
had twice that length, and its moraines formed a veritable amphitheatre of
hills, locally known as <i>regione alla pietre</i>, or stony region. Farther north the
streams of ice descending from the Pennine Alps between the Grand Paradis and
Mont Blanc united in a single stream eighty miles in length, and spread over the
plain far beyond Ivrea. The alluvial accumulation of this ancient glacier rises
1,100 and even 2,130 feet above the valley through which the Dora Baltea now
flows. One of its lateral moraines, known as the <i>Serra d’Ivrea</i>, forms a regular
rampart to the east of the river, eighteen miles in extent. Its slopes are now
covered with chestnuts. The western ravine (Colle di Brossa) is less prominent,
because it is inferior in height; but the frontal ravine,
forming a complete demicircle,
can still be traced readily. In the débris accumulated at the foot of this
ancient glacier, rocks derived from Mont Blanc are mixed with others brought
down from Mont Cervin. And yet it was but a dwarf when compared with
the ancient twin glacier of the Ticino and the Adda, which extended from the
Simplon to the Stelvio, filled up the cavities now occupied by
the Lago Maggiore <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
and the Lake of Como, sent a lateral branch to the tortuous bed of the Lake of
Lugano, and finally, after a course of from 100 to 120 miles, debouched upon the
plain of Lombardy. The glacier of the Oglio was small in comparison with it,
but it was exceeded by that of the Adige, the most considerable of all on the
southern slope of the Alps. This river of ice, from the mountains of the
Oetzthal, where it originated, to its terminal moraine to the north of Mantua,
had a length of 175 miles. One of its branches descended towards the east, down
the valley of the Drave, as far as where the town of Klagenfurt now stands. Its
main stream filled up the cavity of the Lake of Garda, pushing along a formidable
rampart of elevated moraines.</p>

<p>The hand of man is scarcely able to make an impression
upon the vast accumulations heaped up by the action of the
glaciers. The hills of Solferino, of Cavriana, and Somma
Campagna, so often named in connection with battles, are
nothing but débris brought down from the flanks of the
Alps, and they were much higher formerly than they are now. <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span></p>

<p>Some of the erratic blocks were as large as houses, but, being used as quarries,
they are fast disappearing. One of them at Pianezza, at the mouth of the
Susa valley, is 80 feet long, 40 feet broad, and 46 feet high, and a chapel has
been built upon it. The huge erratic blocks in the hills between the two arms of
the Lake of Como have supplied materials for the monolithic columns of the
churches and palaces in the environs. The slopes of the hills of Turin facing the
Alps are likewise covered with erratic blocks.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>When the glaciers retired into the upper valleys of the Alps, the soil which
they covered was left bare, and the depressions now occupied by the beautiful
lakes of Lombardy were revealed. These depressions, whose bottom even now
sinks down below the level of the ocean, were formerly arms of the sea, in
character very much like the fiords of Norway. That such was the case is proved
by the presence, in every one of the Lombard lakes, of a sardine (the <i>agone</i>),
which naturalists consider to be a sea fish. In Garda Lake, moreover, there still
dwell two marine fishes which have adapted themselves to their new condition of
life, as well as a small marine shell-fish.</p>

<p>The number of these Alpine lakes was much larger formerly, and those
which still exist shrink from year to year. In Upper Piemont alluvial deposits
have long ago filled up the lakes, and there now only remain a
few pools of <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
water to indicate their site. The first sheets of water to which the term “lake”
may fairly be applied are met with on both banks of the Dora Baltea (see
Fig. 57). The little basin of Candia and the shallow Lake of Azeglio, to the west
and east of the river, are the only remains of <i>Lacus Clisius</i>, which covered an area
of several hundred square miles until its waters broke through the semicircular
terminal moraine which bounded it on the south. The Dora Baltea formerly
escaped from this lake in the south-east, its present course only dating from the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Since this reservoir has been drained, the first lake of importance in the west
is that of Verbano, very inappropriately called Lago Maggiore, or the “principal
lake,” as that of Garda exceeds it in extent. Ancient beaches, at an elevation of
1,300 feet above the sea, prove that the waters of the lake have considerably
subsided, and that its area was much larger formerly; and it curiously ramified
with neighbouring lake basins, now merely connected with it by rivers. The
ancient moraine at the foot of this lake, and through which the Ticino has excavated
itself a passage, still rises to a height
of 980 feet. <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span></p>

<p>Centuries elapsed before the changes which we now perceive were accomplished.
Still they proceeded at a sufficiently rapid rate. Even now the alluvium
carried down by the Ticino and the Maggia continually encroaches upon
the Lago Maggiore. Seven hundred years ago the village of Gordola stood on
the shore of the lake: it is now nearly a mile away from it. The landing-places
of Magadino, at the mouth of the Ticino, have to be continually shifted, for the
lake retires steadily. Only sixty years ago barges were able to receive their
cargoes at a wharf nearly half a mile higher up than the present one. The Gulf
of Locarno is gradually being separated from the main sheet of water by alluvial
deposits brought down by the Maggia.</p>

<p>The Lario, or Lake of Como, which rivals the Maggiore by its beauty, is
likewise being gradually silted up. In the time of the Romans the navigation
extended as far as Summolacus (lake-head), the modern Samolaco. But the
torrent of Mera gradually converted most of the upper extremity of the lake into
an alluvial plain, whilst the alluvial deposits carried down by the Adda cut off
the remainder from the main body of water. There now remains
only the <i>Lacus</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
<i>Dimidiatus</i>, or Lake of Mezzola, which is shrinking from year to year, and will
finally disappear altogether. The miasmata rising from the swamps at the mouth
of the Adda have frequently depopulated the environs, and the ruined fort of
Fuentes, at the mouth of the river, built to defend the Val Tellina, was hardly
ever more than a hospital for its fever-stricken garrison.</p>

<p>The south-eastern arm of the lake, that of Lecco, through which the Adda
makes its escape to the south, has likewise been divided into a series of separate
basins. Nature, which would convert these lakes into bottom-lands at no distant
date, is being aided here by the works of man. The barrier which obstructed the
free egress of the Adda has been cleared away, the structures of fishermen have
been removed, and, in consequence of these and other engineering measures, the
once-dreaded rises of the lake have been reduced to a minimum, and the southernmost
of the lake basins, that of Brivio, has been converted into dry land. The
large Lake of Brianza, which extended formerly far to the south-west, has likewise
been partially drained, and there now remain only a few lakelets of small
extent.</p>

<p>We know sufficient of the bottom of the Lake of Como to enable us to judge
of the manner in which it is becoming gradually filled up with alluvium. The
mud deposited in its northern portion has filled up all the original inequalities of
the soil, and even in the centre of the lake, and in its south-eastern arm, the
bottom is almost a perfect level. In the Como arm, however, which receives no
tributary river of any importance, the bottom is still full of inequalities. These
differences amply prove to us the geological agency of the rivers, which must
terminate in the lake being converted into a bottom-land, with a river flowing
through its centre. The third of our diagrams (Fig. 62) shows that the greatest
depth now hardly exceeds 1,300 feet, whilst, if we may judge from the slopes of
the hills which bound it, the depth in former times cannot have been less than
2,300 feet.</p>

<p>The Sebino, or Lake of Iseo, and the lakelet of Idro, which are fed by the
glacier streams of the Adamello, exhibit the same features as the lakes farther to
the west. The Benaco, or Lake of Garda, however, the most extensive of these
Alpine lakes, is very stable as regards its outline and the configuration of its
bottom, a fact sufficiently explained by the small size of its tributary streams as
compared with its vast area. The old Alpine lakes of the Venetian Alps have
disappeared long ago, and there remain only a few ponds, filling cavities in the
dolomitic rocks and peat bogs, to indicate their
ancient sites.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn64" id="fnanch64">64</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span></p>

<p>These lacustrine basins, like all other reservoirs of the same kind, regulate the
outflow of the torrents which empty into them. During the freshets they store
up the superabundant waters, and only part with them in the dry season, and
upon their difference of level in different seasons depend the oscillations of the
emissary rivers which issue from them. In the case of the Lake of Garda, which
drains but a small area in proportion to its size, this difference is small, and
throughout the year the pellucid waters of the Mincio flow tranquilly beneath the
blackened ramparts of Peschiera. Such is not the case as regards either the Lago
Maggiore or the Lake of Como, for the volume of water discharged into them
is so considerable that their level in summer and winter varies to the extent
of several yards, and corresponding differences may be observed in the rivers
issuing from them. Lake Como rises no less than 12 feet, and increases
70 square miles in area, whilst the Lago Maggiore sometimes rises
22 feet, and <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
increases to the extent of one-fifth. The volume of the Ticino, when at its highest,
almost equals the average volume of the Nile, and if it were not for the regulating
influence of the lake from which it issues, it would alternately convert the plains
of Lombardy into a sheet of water and leave them an arid tract of land.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn65" id="fnanch65">65</a></p>

<p>The Alpine lakes of Italy thus play an important part in the economy of
the country. They render the climate more equable, serve as high-roads of
commerce, and, being the centres of animal life, attract a dense population. But
it is not this which has rendered these lakes famous, which has attracted thousands
of wanderers ever since the time of the Romans, and caused villas and
palaces to rise on their shores: it is their incomparable beauty. And, indeed,
there are few spots in Europe which bear comparison with the delightful Gulf of
Pallanza, over which are scattered the Borromean Islands, or with the peninsula
of Bellagio, which may be likened to a hanging garden suspended within sight
of the snow-clad Alps, and affording a prospect of the rock-bound shores of the
Como Lake, cultivated fields, and numerous villas. Perhaps even more delightful
is the peninsula of Sermione, jutting out into the azure waters of the Garda Lake,
like the tender stalk of a flower developing into a many-coloured petal.</p>

<p>Most of the lakes in the plain have been drained into the neighbouring rivers.
The Lake of Gerondo, mentioned in mediæval records, has dwindled down into a
small swamp, or <i>mosi</i>, now, and its populous island of Fulcheria has become merged
in the plain of Lombardy. The lakes on the southern bank of the Po, above
Guastalla, have likewise been drained; and if the two shallow lakes of Mantua
still exist, this is entirely due to the embankments raised in the twelfth century.
It would have been much better, and would have saved the city the horrors of
many a siege, if these lakes had been allowed to disappear likewise.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The lagoons along the Adriatic have decreased in extent in the course of
centuries, and whilst new lagoons are being formed, the old ones are gradually
being converted into dry land. The old maps of the Venetian littoral differ
essentially from our modern ones, and yet all the vast changes they indicate have
been wrought in the course of a few centuries. The swamps of Caorle, between
the Piave and the Gulf of Trieste, have changed to an extent which prevents us
from restoring the ancient topography of the country; and if the lagoons of Venice
and Chioggia exhibit a certain permanence of contour, this is only on account of
the incessant interference of man. The ancient lagoon of Brondolo has been dry
land since the middle of the sixteenth century. The large lagoon of Comacchio,
to the south of the Po, has been cut up into separate portions by alluvial embankments
formed by the agency of rivers and torrents. For the most part it consists
now of <i>valli</i>, or alluvial deposits, but there still remain a few profound cavities, or
<i>chiari</i>, which the rivers have not yet succeeded in filling up.
Formerly these <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
lagoons extended far to the south in the direction of Ravenna, and, according to
Strabo and other ancient writers,
that ancient city once occupied a
site very much like that of Venice
or Chioggia in our own days.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that these
lagoons were anciently separated
from the Adriatic by a narrow strip
of land over 120 miles in length,
and similar to what we still meet
with on the coasts of Carolina and
of the Brazils. This ancient barrier
still exists in the <i>lidi</i> of Venice and
Comacchio, which are pierced at
intervals, admitting the vivifying
floods of the open sea. Elsewhere
the traces of this ancient beach
must be looked for on the mainland.
The low delta of the Po is traversed
from north to south by a range of
dunes constituting the continuation
of the lidi of Venice, and extending
into the swamps of Comacchio,
where they form a natural embankment
running parallel with the
coast. These dunes, between the
Adige and Cervia, are covered with
sombre pine woods, replaced here
and there by oaks. The underwood
mainly consists of hawthorns and
juniper-trees, and wild boars still
haunt it.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>No sooner have the lagoons protected
by these barriers been converted
into dry land than the sea
seizes upon the sand, and forms it
into new curvilinear barriers similar
to the former ones. The principal
range of dunes to the east of
Ravenna, which is about 20 miles
in length, and varies in width
between 50 and 3,300 yards, has
thus two other ranges of dunes
running parallel with it, one of them being still in course
of formation. Signor <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
Pareto has estimated the annual advance of the land at 7﻿½ feet, and at much more
near the mouths of rivers.</p>

<p>The sea thus marks by a series of barriers its successive recoils. Sometimes,
however, the sea gains upon the land in consequence of a gradual subsidence of the
Venetian shore, the cause of which has not yet been elucidated. Thus the gravel
bank of Cortellazzo, opposite the swamps of Caorle, appears to have anciently
been a <i>lido</i> which has sunk nearly 70 feet below the level of the sea. The islands
which fringed the littoral of Aquileja during the Middle Ages have almost wholly
disappeared. In the time of the Romans these islands were populous; there
were forests and fields upon them, and the inhabitants built ships. The chronicles
of the Middle Ages tell us that the Doge of Venice and the Patriarch of Aquileja
hunted stags and wild boars upon them, much to the scandal of the inhabitants.
At the present day the dunes which of yore protected these islands have almost
wholly disappeared, the forests have been supplanted by reeds, and Grado is
the only place on the littoral which may still boast of a certain number of inhabitants.
Piers, walls, mosaic pavements, and even stones bearing inscriptions,
which are found occasionally at the bottom of the sea or of swamps, prove that
the mainland was formerly more extensive there. Farther to the west the
littoral of Venice bears evidence of a similar subsidence. Artesian wells sunk in
the city of the lagoons have led to the discovery of four beds of turf, the deepest
no less than 420 feet below the level of the sea. The subterranean church of
St. Mark has within historical times been converted into a submarine church, and
streets and buildings are gradually sinking beneath the waters of the lagoons.
If it were not for the alluvium brought down by the rivers, the sea would continually
encroach upon the land. Ravenna, too, participates in this subsidence,
which Signor Pareto estimates to amount to 0·60 inch in the course of a century.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Amongst the geological agents constantly at work to modify the surface of the
earth, the rivers and torrents irrigating the plain lying at the foot of the Alps are
the most active, and no other country of Europe, Holland alone excepted, can
compare in this respect with Northern Italy.</p>

<p>The torrent of Isonzo offers one of the most striking instances of these geological
revolutions. It is said to have formerly communicated through subterranean
channels with the Istrian Timavo, and that its existence as a separate river
does not date very far back. Ancient writers do not enumerate the Isonzo amongst
the rivers flowing into the Adriatic. It is first mentioned in a document of the
sixth century as a river irrigating some inland valley. On Peutinger’s Table we
meet with a station, Ponte Sonti, far to the east of Aquileja, and near the sources
of the Timavo. The chronicles are silent with respect to the peripatetics of this
river, but a careful examination of the surrounding hills justifies the assumption
that the valley of Tolmein, on the Upper Isonzo, was formerly a lake which overflowed
towards the north-west through the narrows of Caporetto, and that its
pent-up waters found their way through the Natisone into the Adriatic. Subsequently
they opened themselves a passage to the south, and
another lake was <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
formed at the confluence of Isonzo and Wippach. This lake communicated by
subterranean channels with the Timavo, but it has now disappeared, and the Isonzo
flows directly into the sea, its bed wandering continuously towards the east. The
alluvium carried down by this river has formed the peninsula of Sdobba, and
joined several old islands to the mainland.</p>

<p>The Tagliamento is even a more active geological agent than its neighbour just
beyond the frontier. The débris deposited at the mouth of the narrow gorge in
which it rises covers many square miles of a once fertile plain. In summer its
waters trickle through these accumulations of shingle, but after heavy rain the
river is converted into a powerful torrent several miles in width, and all the more
formidable as its bed lies higher than many parts of the surrounding country.
The Meduna and Zelline, to the west of the Tagliamento, are equally destructive,
and an extensive tract at their confluence is covered with shingles. Lower down,
in the lagoons, these torrents have thrown up huge embankments of sand on either
side of their ancient beds. The alluvium brought down by these torrents to the
sea is in every instance deposited to the west, a circumstance accounted for by the
direction of the coast current.</p>

<p>The Piave, the most considerable river to the east of the Adige, is likewise a
most active geological agent, converting fertile fields into sterile shingle tracts,
filling up swamps, and carrying large quantities of matter into the
sea. At its <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
mouth the land gains rapidly upon the sea, and Heraclea of the Veneti, now
known as Cittanova, which was a seaport once, at the present time lies far inland.</p>

<p>The Piave was formerly supposed to have changed its bed in the same manner
as the Isonzo. Below the Capo di Ponte, a wild defile in the Dolomite Alps, the
Piave flows towards the south-west, past Belluno, and lower down is joined by the
Cordevole. It was, however, supposed that the river originally flowed through the
valley of Rai, immediately to the south of the Capo di Ponte, and that the Meschio
and Livenzo constituted its lower course. Earthquakes or landslips were supposed
to have created a barrier across that valley, and the small lakes still seen there were
looked upon as remains of the ancient river bed. But M. de Mortillet has shown
that this hypothesis is untenable, for the barrier referred to is merely the moraine of
an ancient glacier, and there exist no traces whatever of landslips.</p>

<p>At the same time it cannot be doubted that extensive changes have taken place
in the basin of the Piave. Thus in 1771 the course of the Cordevole, its most
important tributary, was obstructed for a time by a landslip which carried the
verdant terraces of Pezza down into the valley. Two villages were destroyed, and
two others overwhelmed by the rising floods of the river.</p>

<p>The Brenta, which rises in the beautiful Sugana valley of the Tyrol, has at all
times been a source of anxiety to the Venetians on account of its irregularities.
Formerly it entered the lagoons at Fusina, and its alluvium
filled up the canals <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
and infected the air. The Paduans and other inhabitants of the lowlands were
anxious to divert it by the most direct course into the lagoons, so as to
avoid inundations, whilst the Venetians were solicitous to get rid of a river which
threatened to fill up their lagoons and render them insalubrious. These conflicting
interests gave rise to numerous wars. The possession of the coast became a
question of existence to the Venetians, and no sooner had they obtained it than
they set about “regulating” the Lower Brenta. Hy means of two canals, the
Brenta Nuova, or Brentone, and the Brenta Nuovissima, the river was conducted
right round the lagoons to the port of Brondolo, a few miles to the north of the
Adige. But the river, whose course had thus been considerably lengthened,
gradually filled up the bed in its upper course, and it was
found impossible to <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
confine it within its lateral embankments. They were broken through by the
floods no less than twenty times between 1811 and 1859, and, as the channel of
the river became more and more choked, a more frequent recurrence of such
disasters was naturally expected. It was then resolved to shorten the course of the
river to the extent of ten miles, by diverting it into a portion of the lagoon of
Chioggia. The danger of irruptions has thus been averted for a time, but the
fisheries of Chioggia have been completely destroyed, and fever is a frequent visitor
in the towns of the littoral.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that but for the efforts of the Venetian engineers the
lagoons of the Lido, Malamocco, and Chioggia would long ago have been converted
into dry land. Venice has at all times been alive to the necessity of
preserving its precious inland sea. The Venetian engineers were not content with
turning aside the torrents which formerly poured their waters into the lagoons;
they have also, by means of canals, moved the mouths of the Sile and Piave to the
east, thus securing the ports of the Lido from the dreaded alluvium of the rivers.
They even conceived the gigantic project of a huge encircling canal for the
interception of all the Alpine torrents between the Brenta and Isonzo. This project,
however, has never been carried out. The débris carried southward by the coast
current has silted up the port of the Lido, which was abandoned towards the close
of the fifteenth century, when a new military port was constructed eight miles
farther south, at the canal of Malamocco, and it is now protected by a pier
extending 7,200 feet into the sea.</p>

<p>The torrents which descend from the slopes of the Apennines to the south
of the delta of the Adige and Po are as erratic in their course as those of
Venetia. The Trebbia, the Taro, and other rivers irrigating the districts of
Piacenza and Parma only cross a narrow plain between the mountains and the Po,
and do not much modify the topography of the country. But this cannot be said
of the rivers flowing through the vast plains of Modena, Bologna, Ferrara, and
Imola. They are constantly changing their beds, and the remains of embankments
met with all over the country prove that all efforts to confine them permanently
have proved abortive. Modena itself was once destroyed by the floods of the
Secchia. The Tanaro, the Reno, and other rivers flowing towards the north-west,
either into the canal encircling the lagoons of Comacchio or direct into the
sea, all have a history attached to them; they are blessed for their fertilising
alluvium, cursed on account of their destructive floods. One of them, probably
the Fiumicino, is the famous Rubicon which bounded the Italy of the Romans,
and which was crossed by Cæsar when he pronounced the fatal words, “Alea
jacta est.”</p>

<p>The Reno is the most erratic, the most dangerous of all these Apennine rivers.
The bed of débris deposited by it in the plain measures 20 miles across from east
to west. Its volume varies between 35 and 49,500 cubic feet a second, according
to the season, and its bed is in places no less than 30 feet above the adjoining
country. The destruction of the forests has augmented the danger of its inundations.
The engineers, puzzled by its irregular floods, have
proposed the most <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
opposite plans for subduing this terrible scourge. The river has been turned
into the Po; then eastward, direct into the sea. Recently it has been proposed to
divert it to the lagoons of Comacchio. But all these diversions are attended
with disadvantages, and whilst the inhabitants of one district congratulate themselves
upon having got rid of so troublesome a neighbour, those of another complain
of its inundations, see their fisheries destroyed, and their navigation interfered
with.</p>

<p>Lombardini, the famous hydraulic engineer, has shown how we may discover
the places to which the soil of the lowlands of Emilia has been conveyed by the
torrents, and trace the ancient shores of the lagoon of Padua, now converted into
dry land. A traveller following the Emilian causeway from Cesena to Bologna
can hardly help noticing the quadrangular fields on his right, all of them of the
same size. Looked at from the spurs of the Apennines, the plain resembles a huge
draught-board, the squares of which are covered alternately with verdure and
ripening crops. We learn from the topographical maps that these fields are
exactly of the same size, and there can be no doubt that we have here before us the
fields which, according to Livy, were taken from the Gauls and distributed amongst
Roman military settlers. A sinuous line marks, in the direction of the Po, the
shore of an ancient lake. The rectangular fields, laid out by the cadastral surveyors
of ancient Rome, cease there, and we find ourselves again amidst the usual
labyrinth of ditches and tortuous roads. This lake has been filled up long ago by
the débris brought down
by the torrents. <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span></p>

<p>The Po, proportionately to the area it drains and its length, has undergone
fewer changes than either the Piave or the Reno, but looking to the populous
cities which line its banks, and to the fertility of its fields, the least of these is of
some importance.</p>

<p>The torrent fed by the snows of Monte Viso is usually looked upon as the head
stream of Father Po, as the ancient Romans called the river; but the Mastra,
Varaita, and Clusone are quite equal to it in volume, and feed as many canals of
irrigation. Indeed, these canals would quickly drain the Po if it were not for a
bountiful supply of snow-water brought down by the Dora Riparia, the Stura, the
Orca, and the Dora Baltea from the glaciers of the Alps. Lower down, the Po
receives the Sesia from the north, and the Tanaro, which is fed by streams rising
in the Apennines and the Alps. Then comes the Ticino, by far the most important
tributary of the Po, “without which,” as the river fishermen say, “il Po non
sarebbe Po.”</p>

<p>The Po, after its junction with the Ticino, exhibits no longer the features of a
mountain torrent; the pebbles have been triturated into the finest dust, and no
piled-up masses of débris are met with along its banks. If it were not for its
dykes, or <i>argini</i>, it might spread itself freely over the plain. These artificial
embankments rival those of the Netherlands, and date back to the most remote
ages. Lucian refers to them as if they had existed from time immemorial.
During the great migration of peoples they were allowed to decay, and only in the
course of the ninth century were measures taken to restore them. In 1480 the
great work had been achieved. Its importance may be judged from the fact that
these embankments protect 3,000,000 acres of the most fertile land, yielding
annually more than £8,000,000 sterling’s worth of agricultural produce. Most
of the towns have been built upon artificial platforms or terraces, and up to the
beginning of this century they have never been known to suffer from floods; but
whether owing to the devastation of the forests or to the closing up of all breaches
in the dykes, the floods rise higher now than they did of yore, and it has been
found necessary to throw up embankments around Revere, Sermide, Ostiglia,
Governolo, Borgoforte, and other places.</p>

 DELTA OF THE PO</div>
<img src="images/ib210b.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" />
</div><!--dctr-->

<p>Continuous embankments begin at Cremona, and they extend not only along
both banks of the Po, but also along the lower course of its tributaries. The main
dykes have a length of nearly 650 miles. In addition to these there are smaller
dykes traversing the space between these <i>froldi</i>, or main dykes, in all directions,
and enclosing willow plantations, fields, and even vineyards. In fact, the river
extends to the foot of the main dykes only in a few localities. It is ordinarily
only 650 to 1,600 feet wide, whilst the dykes are several miles apart, to allow the
river to spread during the inundations. The land thus lying within the dykes has
been divided by the villagers into <i>golene</i>, and is protected by smaller dykes against
ordinary floods. The rules laid down for the construction of embankments have
been drawn up in the general interest, and are sufficiently precise, but they are not
always observed. The old system, embodied in the dreadful proverb, “Vita mia,
morte tua,” is not yet quite extinct. Formerly the
peasants were in the habit of <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
crossing over to the other bank, and deliberately cutting through the embankments
there, thus saving their own crops by ruining their neighbours’.</p>

<p>The width of the bed of inundation enclosed between these embankments
grows less in proportion as we descend the river, and in the case of the arms of
the delta does not exceed 900 to 1,600 feet. This is not sufficient to enable the
waters to escape during extraordinary floods, when they sometimes rise 25 and
even 30 feet. Besides, it frequently happens that the villagers fail to keep the
embankments in thorough repair, and sometimes entire districts are ruined because
the mole-tracks were not stopped up. A breach in the embankment, unless
quickly filled up, produces untold misery. The crops are destroyed, the villages
levelled with the ground, the soil is torn up and carried off, and the inhabitants
are swept away by famine and its fearful attendant, typhus fever. These great
floods of the Po and the earthquakes of Calabria are the two plagues of Italy. In
1872 1,200 square miles between the Secchia and the sea were converted into a
lake. Two years afterwards there still remained pools of water.</p>

<p>In these great disasters the inhabitants are afforded an opportunity of exhibiting
their valour, and it is always the most energetic who succeed in protecting their
property from being washed away by the floods. During the
flood just referred <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
to, the inhabitants of the little town of Ostiglia fought successfully with the
rising waters, whilst many of their neighbours succumbed. The town stands close
to the <i>froldo</i>, and there is no second line of dykes to protect it. The dyke
threatened to give way. The inhabitants at once set about throwing up a second
barrier. All the able-bodied men of the place, 4,000 in number, turned out to
work, headed by their mayor. They worked day and night, and, as the floods
carried away the old dyke, the new one rose in its rear. The victory was won; the
floods retired, and their houses were safe.</p>

<p>Some of those breaches in the dykes have led to permanent changes in the
course of the river, and these divagations have been most considerable in the delta.
During the time of the Romans, and up to the thirteenth century, the Po di Volano
was the principal branch of the river, whilst now it has dwindled down to an
insignificant ditch which can hardly be traced through the swamps of Comacchio.
Two other branches, farther to the south, are used now as carriage roads. In the
eighth century the Po di Primaro, which enters the sea to the north of Ravenna,
took the place of these old channels. Another bifurcation ensued in 1152,
when the embankment at Ficcarolo was destroyed, it is said, by the people living
above that town, and the main channel of the river, the Maestra, deserted the
walls of Ferrara in the midst of its swamps, and united itself with the channels of
the Adige. Breaches in the embankments usually take place in October or
November, and generally at the same places. The danger is always greatest at
Corbola, where the Po di Maestra bifurcates.</p>

<p>The Adige is quite as great a wanderer as the Po. Scarcely has that river left
its defile, or <i>chiusa</i>, of calcareous mountains and the fortifications of Verona than it
begins its erratic course over the plain. In the time of the Romans the Adige
flowed much farther to the north, along the foot of the Euganean Hills, and entered
the sea at Brondolo. In 587 the river broke through its embankments, and its main
branch took the direction which it maintains up to the present day, entering the
sea at Fossone. But new channels opened repeatedly towards the south, until the
Adige and Po conjointly formed but one delta. The Polesina of Rovigo, between
the two rivers, and that of Ferrara, are low tracts of alluvial land. The courtyard
of the Castle of Ferrara, which occupies one of the most elevated sites in these plains,
is nine feet lower than the highest level of the Po when flooded.</p>

<p>The frequent inundations caused by the Po and the numerous changes of its bed,
by spreading the alluvium all over the country, have raised the whole of the plains
to about the same level. But now, when all the arms of the Po are confined within
embankments, most of the alluvium brought down by the floods is deposited on the
coast of the Adriatic. The land, therefore, gains much more rapidly upon the
sea than it did formerly. The series of dunes marking the ancient shore now lies
fifteen miles inland, and the new land formed annually is estimated at 280 acres.
In exceptional years the quantity of solid matter carried by the river into the sea
amounts to 3,531,000,000 cubic feet; on an average it is 1,623,000,000 cubic feet,
sufficient to form an island ten square miles in area in ten feet of water. The Po,
next to the Danube, is the most active geological agent amongst
all the rivers <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
entering the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn66" id="fnanch66">66</a> The Rhone is inferior to it, and so is the Nile. At
the present rate of progress, the Po, in the course of a thousand years, will throw a
tongue of land six miles wide across the Adriatic, converting the Gulf of Trieste
into an inland sea.</p>

<p>Northern Italy, in addition to these numerous rivers, possesses one of the most
extensive systems of canals in the world, which has served as a pattern to all the
rest of Europe. Lombardy, portions of Piemont, the Campagna of Turin, the
Lomellina on the Ticino, and the Polesinas of Ferrara and Rovigo possess a
wonderful ramification of irrigation, which carries fertile alluvium to the exhausted
fields. In the Middle Ages, when the remainder of Europe was still shrouded in
darkness, the Lombard republics already practised the art of irrigation on the
vastest scale, and drained their low-lying plains. Milan, after she had thrown off
the yoke of her German oppressors, towards the close of the twelfth century, constructed
the <i>Naviglio Grande</i>, a ship canal derived from the Ticino, thirty miles
distant—probably the first great engineering work of the kind in Europe. In the
beginning of the thirteenth century the superabundant waters of the Adda were
utilised in filling the Muzza Canal. The same river, at a subsequent period, was
made to feed another canal, the Martesana, which was constructed by the great
Leonardo da Vinci. The art of surmounting elevations of the ground by means of
locks had been discovered by Milanese engineers about a century before that time,
and was applied to the construction of secondary canals. Amongst works of more
recent date are the <i>naviglio</i> from Milan to Pavia; the Cavour Canal, fed by the Po,
below Turin; and the Canal of Verona, derived from the Adige.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn67" id="fnanch67">67</a></p>

<p>Not only the rivers of Northern Italy, but also the springs, or <i>fontanelle</i>, however
small, which burst forth at the foot of the Alps, are utilised for purposes of
irrigation. Virgil alludes to these springs in his Bucolics, where he says,
“Children, stop the water; the meadows have drunk enough.” Lombardy
is indebted to these springs for her fine prairies, or <i>marcite</i>, which sometimes
yield eight crops a year. The great Adriatic plain has indeed undergone vast
changes through the work of man. Originally it was a swamp surrounded by
forests and heaths, but is now one of the best-cultivated countries of Europe.
One of its great features consists in plantations of mulberries, the uniformity of
which is relieved in many districts—and especially in the
Brianza of Como, that <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
garden of Italy—by groups of tall trees, little lakes, and sinuous valleys. There
still remain extensive heaths covering the moraines of ancient glaciers, which
become more and more sterile from year to year; but the engineers are considering
schemes for irrigating them by means of the fertilising waters of the Alpine
lakes.</p>

<p>The irrigated area in the valley of the Po nearly amounts to 5,000 square
miles, and the water it absorbs every second is estimated at 35,000,000 cubic
feet, equal to about one-third of the volume of the Po. If the proposed works
of irrigation are carried out, the Po, which now plays so important a part in the
economy of the country by its floods and alluvial deposits, will be reduced to
the dimensions of a small river.</p>

<p>The evaporation from the numerous rivers and canals of the country fills the
air with moisture. Rains are less frequent than on the Atlantic coasts of England
and France, but the clouds, driven by southerly winds against the cool slopes of
the Alps, discharge themselves in torrents. The quantity of rain that falls in the
upper Alpine valleys equals that of the most humid districts of Portugal, the
Hebrides, and Norway, and the rainfall in the plains of Lombardy is equal to that
of Ireland. The annual rainfall in the basin of the Piave is estimated at five feet,
exclusive of what may evaporate or be absorbed by plants. These rains are not
confined to certain seasons, though it has been observed that they are most
abundant in May and October, and least so in February and July.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn68" id="fnanch68">68</a></p>

<p>As regards the direction of the winds, the great plain bounded by the Apennines
and the Alps resembles an Alpine valley, the winds either blowing up it
from east to west, or in an inverse direction. The winds descending from the
Alps rarely bring rain, for they have deposited their moisture on the western
slopes, but those coming from the Adriatic are generally charged with moisture.
Nevertheless, owing to the great extent of the plains and the numerous breaks in
the mountain chains, this rule is frequently interfered with. In the Alpine valleys
the ascending and descending currents are far more regular, and the navigators on
the lakes fully avail themselves of this circumstance.</p>

<p>The forty-fifth degree of north latitude intersects the valley of the Po, but the
climate, nevertheless, is not as mild as might be expected from this circumstance,
and the range of temperature is great. In the Val Tellina the temperature sometimes
rises above 90°, and frequently fails below freezing point. In the plain the
climate is less austere, but it is not­with­stand­ing continental in its character; and
Turin, Milan, and Bologna are for this reason the least pleasant cities of Italy to live
in. A few favoured spots on the Alpine lakes, such as the Borromean Islands, are
an exception to this rule, and enjoy an equable climate, thanks to the moderating
influences of a vast expanse of water. In the Gulf of Pallanza the thermometer
never falls below 40° F., and we must go as far as Naples if we would meet with
a climate equally favourable to vegetation. Venice, too, is a privileged spot,
thanks to the vicinity of the Adriatic, and is healthy, too,
in spite of the lagoons <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
which surround it. It is remarkable that these brackish lakes and swamps of
Northern Italy do not give rise to the dreaded malarial fevers. Venice undoubtedly
owes its healthiness to the tides, which are higher there than in the Tyrrhenian
Sea, and perhaps, also, to the cold winds descending from the Alps. Comacchio, too,
is a healthy place, and young natives of the Polesina suffering from consumption
are sent there to recover their health. Wherever the engineers have cut up the
connection between the lagoons and the open sea, marsh fever has made its
appearance. The swamps of Ravenna and Cervia breed malignant fevers, especially
where avaricious landowners have cut down the protecting rows of pines and oaks.
A heavy miasmal air hangs likewise over the environs of Ferrara and Malalbergo,
at the head of the Paduan delta.</p>

<p>The Alpine valleys are the most unhealthy spots of Northern Italy, for they
are deprived of sunlight. Goître and idiotcy are frequent there, and in the valley
of Aosta nearly all the women are afflicted with the former, owing, perhaps, to the
water which flows over magnesian rocks. The inhabitants of districts traversed
by numerous canals suffer from diseases traceable to miasmal effluvia. The food of
the peasantry is not sufficiently nourishing or varied to counteract these deleterious
influences, and many die of <i>pellagre</i>, an incurable skin disease, only known in countries
where the flour of maize, in the diluted form of <i>polenta</i>, constitutes the principal
article of food. In the province of Cremona one in every twenty-four inhabitants
is afflicted with this malady. The sanitary condition of the people is even
worse in the rice-fields of Milan and the Polesina. The women there frequently
stand for hours in tepid putrefying water, and are obliged from time to time to
pick off the leeches which creep up their legs.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn69" id="fnanch69">69</a></p>

<p>But in spite of maladies, misery, and famines, always following in the train of
the inundations, the fertile plain of the Po is one of the most densely peopled
portions of Europe. Every plot of ground there has been utilised. The forests,
very much reduced in size, harbour no game, except, perhaps, on the Alpine slopes,
and even small birds are rare. Not only snipes, quails, and thrushes are shot or
trapped, but also nightingales and swallows. Tschudi estimates the number of
singing birds annually killed on the shores of the Lago Maggiore at 60,000; and
at Bergamo, Verona, Chiavenna, and Brescia they are slain by millions, the nets
being spread in the hedges of every hill.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The population of the valley of the Po is composed of the most diverse
elements. Amongst its ancestors were Ligurians, probably the kinsmen of our
Basks; Etruscans, famous for their works of irrigation; Gallic tribes, whose
peculiar intonation is still traceable in the rural Latin spoken in Northern Italy;
and Celtic Ombrians, the most remote of all, and looked upon by historians as the
aboriginal inhabitants of the country.</p>

<p>The German invasions during the first centuries of our era
have left a <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
permanent mark upon the population of Northern Italy. The many tall men met with
in the valley of the Po are proofs of this Transalpine influence. The Goths and
Vandals, Herulians and Longobards, or Lombards, soon became merged in the
Latinised masses, but their position as conquerors and feudal lords gave them an
influence which their mere numbers would not have insured them. The ancient
history of Lombardy is a continual struggle between the towns and these feudal
lords, and as soon as the latter had been defeated—that is to say, about the
beginning of the tenth century—German was superseded everywhere by Italian.</p>

<p>Family and topographical names of Lombard origin are very common on the left
bank of the Po, and as far as the foot of the Apeninnes. Marengo, for instance, is
a corruption of the German Mehring.</p>

<p>This German influence upon manners and language has been most enduring in
the Friuil, or Furlanei, a district bounded by the Adriatic, the Carniolan Alps, and
the plateau of the Karst, or Carso. The Friulians were even looked upon as a
distinct race, though their ancestors, like those of most Italians of the north, were
Latinised Celts. Frequent intermarriages with
their Slovenian neighbours <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
contributed in some measure to produce a type distinct from that of Venice or Treviso.
The number of these Friulians still speaking their own dialect does not now exceed
50,000 souls.</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous German colonies of which traces have been found in
the plains of Northern Italy and on the southern slopes of the Alps, the “Thirteen
Communes” to the north of Verona, and the “Seven Communes” in the deep
valleys to the north-west of Bassano, are the most considerable. The <i>homines
Teutonici</i> of these two districts are supposed to be the descendants of the Cimbrians
defeated by Marius, and blue eyes and fair hair still prevail amongst them, but in
all other respects they resemble the Italians of the plains, and only a few old
women amongst them still talk the language of their ancestors, which is said to
resemble the dialect spoken on the Tegern Lake, in Bavaria. Nor were they
the champions of German authority on Italian soil. On the contrary, they were
charged by the Republic of Venice with the defence of the
northern frontier, and <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
have always valiantly acquitted themselves of this duty. In return, they were
granted self-government and exemption from military service. But neither the
Republic of Venice nor Austria was able to protect these German colonies against an
invasion of the “Welsh” or Italian element, and there do not now exist any non-Italian
communities to the east of the great lakes. To the north of Piemont, however,
in the valleys descending from Monte Rosa and in the valley of Pommat, where the
Toce forms one of the most beautiful waterfalls, German colonies still maintain
their ground. They, too, would long ago have lost their language were it not for
the support they receive from the Germans occupying the Swiss valleys on the
northern slopes of the Alps. Alagna, or Olen, one of these German villages,
preserved its ancient customs until quite recently. For centuries there had been
no lawsuit there; contracts, testaments, and other legal documents were unknown;
and everything was regulated by “custom;” that is, by the absolute authority of
the heads of families.</p>

<p>The French element is far more numerous on the Italian slope of the Alps than
the German. The inhabitants of the valley of Aosta, between the Grand Paradis
and the Monte Rosa, of the upper valleys of the Dora Riparia, Cluson, Pelice,
and Varaita, speak French, and are of the same origin as the Savoyards and
Dauphinois on the western slope of the Alps. The configuration of the ground
has facilitated this pacific invasion of the western Celts, numbering about 120,000
souls. They descended from the passes, and occupied the whole of the forest and
pastoral region down to the foot of the hills, the last mountain defile, in many
instances, forming their boundary. But the French language is steadily losing
ground, for the official language is Italian, and every village has already two
names, of which the modern Italian one is used by preference. The Vaudois, or
Waldenses, in the valleys of Pelice (Pellis) and Cluson, above Pinerolo (Pignerol),
alone resist this Italianisation with a certain amount of success, for they have a
literature and history, and are held together by strong religious ties. Their sect
was persecuted as early as the thirteenth century, long before the Reformation, and
ever since, until their final emancipation in 1848, they have struggled against
adversity. Many times it was thought they had been exterminated, but they
always rose again, and in history they occupy a rank far out of proportion to their
small numbers.</p>

<p>The bulk of the population are engaged in agriculture, which need not be
wondered at if we bear in mind the fertility of the soil, the abundant supply of
water, and the improvements effected in bygone ages. The labour invested in
every kind of agricultural improvement, such as canals, embankments, terraces, or
<i>ronchi</i>, built up like steps on the slope of every hill, has been immense, and defies
computation. The mode of cultivation, moreover, entails a vast amount of labour,
for the peasant knows not the iron plough, but tills his field with the spade: he is
a gardener rather than an agriculturist. The agricultural produce is immense;
its annual value is estimated at £80,000,000 sterling, and it furnishes large quantities
for exportation. Cereals, forage, mulberry leaves and cocoons, vegetables
and fruit, and cheese, including the famous Parmesan, are
the principal products. <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
Lombardy and Piemont occupy the first rank in the world for certain kinds of
agricultural produce, and they are almost the only countries in Europe in which
rice, introduced in the beginning of the sixteenth century, is extensively grown.
The vineyards, on the other hand, are not as carefully tended as they might be,
and the wines, with the exception of those of Asti, Monferrato, San Colombano,
and Udine (the <i>picolito</i>), are of small repute.</p>

<p>The valley of the Po divides itself into several well-marked agricultural
provinces. In the Alpine valleys, between Col di Tenda and Monte Tricorno, the
greater portion of the forests and pastures is held in common, but nearly every
mountaineer is likewise the free proprietor of a bit of meadow or land, which his
labour has converted into a garden. The social condition of these mountaineers
thus resembles that of the French peasantry; for they, likewise, enjoy the advantages
of a minute division of the land amongst freehold proprietors. The hilly tracts
along the foot of the mountains are divided into farms of moderate size. The
peasant no longer owns the land, but, in accordance with old feudal customs, he
shares in its produce. In the plain, where it is necessary to keep up a complicated
system of canals, nearly all the land belongs to rich capitalists, who cut it up into
numerous small farms, and for the most part reside in the towns. These small
farmers have no resources of their own, and are hardly above the rank of agricultural
labourers. Though they cultivate the most fertile region of Northern Italy,
they are miserably fed, frequently decimated by disease, and least alive to the
advantages of education. The contrast between these miserable peasants and the
mountaineers of Vaudois and the Val Tellina is great indeed.</p>

<p>Periodically many of the mountaineers migrate to the towns and neighbouring
countries in search of work, and a proverb tells us that there is no country in the
world “without sparrows or Bergamosks.” But though the natives of the hills of
Bergamo furnish a numerous contingent of these migrants, they are outnumbered
by Friulians, inhabitants of the shores of the Lago Maggiore, and Piemontese.
The latter cross the passes of the Western Alps in large numbers in search of
work at Marseilles and other towns of Southern France, and, small wages sufficing
for their frugal wants, they are not particularly liked by their French fellow-workmen.</p>

<p>The metallic wealth of Northern Italy is but small. The only mines of note
are those which formerly supplied the famous armourers of Brescia with iron, and
the gold diggings of Anzasca, at the foot of Monte Rosa, where 5,000 slaves were
kept at work by the Romans, and which are not yet quite exhausted. Marble,
gneiss, granite, potters’ clay, and kaolin are, however, found abundantly. In
former times silks, velvets, carpets, glass, porcelain, metal-work, and other art
productions of the workmen of Venice and Lombardy enjoyed a very high reputation.
These ancient industries decayed with the downfall of the old republics,
but there are signs now of their revival. The want of coal or other fuel for setting
in motion the machinery of modern factories is compensated for, to some extent,
by an abundant water power, and this explains why nearly all the important
manufactories are met with at the debouchures of
the Alpine valleys. <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span></p>

<p>Amongst the ancient industries of the country not yet extinct, the fisheries of
the lagoons of Comacchio occupy a foremost place. The Canal of Magnavacca,
now hardly navigable, admits the waters of the sea into the Canal Palotta, which
may be described as the great artery of these lagoons. It was constructed in
1631–34, and, by an ingeniously designed system of ramifying canals, carries the
vivifying floods to the most remote parts of the lagoons. The various basins,
or <i>valli</i>, of the lagoons are thus filled with sea-water, and constitute as many
breeding beds, where the fish come from the sea multiply abundantly. A labyrinth
of canals provided with flood-gates cuts off their retreat to the sea, and they are
caught in immense numbers when the fishing season arrives. Spallanzani has seen
60,000 pounds of fish taken in a single bed, or <i>valle</i>, within an hour; but sometimes
the draught is even more considerable, and the fish are actually used as manure.
The fishing population of Comacchio numbers about 5,000 individuals, most of
them distinguished by tall stature, great strength, and suppleness. Coste, the
fish-breeder, mentions it as a curious fact that this secluded
colony of fishermen <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
should have retained these characteristic features for centuries, though sustained
exclusively by fishing, and living upon mullets, eels, and <i>acquadelle</i>. Unfortunately
these fishermen are not the proprietors of the ponds, for they belong to the State
or to rich private individuals. The workmen live in large barracks away from the
town, to which they return only at stated intervals, and even their wives and
relatives are not permitted to visit them in their places of exile.</p>

<p>The enormous population of the valley of the Po, which almost equals that of
the remainder of continental Italy, is very unequally distributed; but, except in
the high and cold Alpine valleys, the inhabitants live in towns, dozens of which
may be seen peeping out amidst the verdure if we ascend a high tower. There
are scarcely any villages or hamlets. The farmers alone live in the country,
completely isolated from each other, whilst the numerous landed proprietors throng
the towns, and impart to them an aspect of wealth which similar
places in other <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span>
parts of Europe cannot boast of. No other country in the world is as densely
populated, and in Lombardy the number of towns is relatively larger than anywhere
else.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn70" id="fnanch70">70</a></p>

<p>Large towns, too, are numerous, and many of them enjoy a deserved reputation
amongst the cities of the world on account of their monuments, art treasures, and
historical associations. Their number is partly accounted for by the density of the
population, and by the facility with which the inhabitants were able to shift their
abodes, according to the hazards of war or the vicissitudes of events. And this
accounts, too, for the large number of towns which became famous as the capitals
of republics, or as royal and ducal residences.</p>

<p>Several of the towns at the base of the Alps occupy sites marked out for them
by nature. Such are the towns at the mouth of the valleys or defiles, which were
places of defence as well as staples of commerce. Ariminum, the modern Rimini,
at the southern extremity of the great plain of the Po, was one of these, for during
the reign of the Roman it defended the narrow littoral passage between the
Adriatic and the Apennines. The Flaminian Road there reached the sea, the
Emilian Road thence departed for the north-west, as did also the littoral road of
Ravenna. When Rome had ceased to be the capital of the world, and Italy was
divided into small hostile states, the towns in the southern part of the plain,
or near the passes over the Po, such as Ferrara and Bologna, retained their
strategical importance. Piacenza, which defends the passage of the Po between
Piemont and Emilia, remains a first-rate fortress to the present day; Alessandria,
near the confluence of Tanaro and Bormida, and in a plain famous for many a
bloody battle, was likewise destined to become a formidable fortress, though
derisively called a “city of straw.” Every valley debouching from France or
Austria was locked at its mouth by a strong fort; but most of these places, such as
Vinadio, Pinerolo, Fenestrella, and Susa, have become untenable, owing to the
range of modern artillery.</p>

<p>The defences of the road over the Brenner, ever since the downfall of the
Roman empire, had to be looked to most carefully, for the plain between the
Mincio and the Adige, to the south of the Lake of Garda, is the least-protected part
of Italy from a military point of view. History has proved this. Well might
the peaceable inhabitants of the plain consecrate this Alpine road to the gods, and
intrust its defence to the neighbouring tribes. But the northern barbarians were
not to be stopped by altars; and many a time they swept down it like an avalanche,
pillaging the towns and massacring the inhabitants. No spot on the earth’s surface
has been so frequently saturated with human blood. Most of the battles for the
possession of Italy, down to our own days, were fought near the mouth of the
upper valley of the Adige. Hardly a town or a village of this
small district but <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
has gained a mournful notoriety in the dark pages of human history. It is there
we must seek for the battle-fields of Castiglione, Lonato, Rivoli, Solferino, and
Custozza. When the Austrians held Lombardy and Venice, they took care to
protect this district by the four fortresses known as the Quadrilateral (Verona,
Peschiera, Mantua, and Legnago) and other works. These constituted the “key
of the house,” of which Italy has now repossessed herself.</p>

<p>The configuration of the country which rendered these defiles of the Alps
of importance strategically, likewise insured their commercial importance. The
fortresses were placed there to defend the passes, the commercial entrepôts to
intercept the trade. The rank of these places of commerce depends essentially
upon the number and the importance of the roads which converge upon them.
Turin, upon which converge all the Alpine roads from Mont Blanc to the
Apennines, naturally became one of the vital points of European commerce.
Milan, to which lead the seven great Alpine routes of the Simplon, the Gotthard,
the Bernardino, the Splügen, the Julier, the Maloya, and the Stelvio, was marked
out by nature as a commercial emporium. Bologna, too, which was separated by
the swamps of the Po from the Alpine passes, has risen into importance since
railways have joined it to Vienna, Paris,
Marseilles, and Naples. <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span></p>

<p>The valley of the Po would never have attained its importance in the history
of Europe unless roads had been constructed for traversing the obstructive mountains
which surround it on all sides except towards the east, where it opens out
upon the Adriatic. No other district of Europe is so completely hemmed
in by natural obstacles as is this, but the construction of carriage roads and railways
has converted Northern Italy into one of the great centres of European commerce.
Venice gives it the command of the Adriatic, the Apennine railways connect it
with Genoa, Savona, the Gulf of Spezia, and the Tyrrhenian, and it thus commands
the two seas which wash the shores of Italy. Other railways cross the Alps, and
put it into communication with France and Germany. This central position,
joined to the natural fertility of the country, has converted Northern Italy into one
of the most flourishing portions of Europe. Human hands have conquered
original geographical disadvantages, and the true centre of Italy is in the ancient
Cisalpine Gaul, and not at Rome. Had the Italians been guided in the choice of
their capital by actual importance, and not by historical tradition, they would
have chosen one of the great cities of their northern plain.</p>

<p>Turin, though an old town, seeing that it was burnt by Hannibal, is nevertheless
a modern city, if we compare it with other towns of Italy. Its straight and
broad streets almost give it the appearance of a town of the New World. Until
made a ducal residence, Turin was but a small provincial town. During the time of
the Romans, and even during the Middle Ages, the great high-road between Italy
and Gaul led along the coast of the Gulf of Genoa. The passage of the Alps
was looked upon with dread by travellers. Still some traffic went on
even in these <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
early days, and small towns sprang into existence at the foot of each Alpine
pass. Amongst these were Mondovi, the triple town built on three hills; Cuneo,
favourably placed upon a terrace between Stura and Gesso, in which rise
the hot sulphur springs of Valdiera; Saluzzo, on the gentle slope of the foot-hills
of Monte Viso; Pinerolo, with its ancient castle, so often converted into a
prison of state; Susa, the Italian key of Mont Cenis; Aosta, still abounding in
Roman antiquities; Ivrea, built on a site formerly occupied by a glacier
descending from Monte Rosa; and Riella, with its flourishing woollen industry.
The towns lower down in the plain, upon which several of these Alpine roads
converged, likewise attained some local importance. In Upper Piemont there are
Fossano, on a heap of shingle at the junction of the roads of Mondovi and Cuneo;
Savigliano, lower down, where the roads of the Po and Maira valleys join; and
Carmagnola, which commands one of the principal roads over the Apennines.
Novara, the commercial outlet of the Lago Maggiore, and in the midst of one of
the most productive agricultural districts, is the most populous town of Eastern
Piemont. Vercelli, on the Sesia, and below the confluence of the rivulets descending
from Monte Rosa, enjoys natural advantages similar to those of Novara.
Casale, the ancient capital of Monferrato, defends one of the principal passages of
the Po.</p>

<p>But Turin, owing to its favourable position, has become the great emporium
of the valley of the Upper Po. Its commerce has grown immensely, since the
town no longer enjoys the perilous honour of being the capital of a kingdom,
and the places vacated by the court and Government officials have been filled up
quickly by immigrants carried thither by the railways. Its libraries, a fine
museum, and various learned societies entitle it to rank as one of the intellectual
centres of the peninsula, whilst its manufactures of silks and woollens, of paper
and other articles, are of great importance. The environs of Turin are delightful.
From the hill of the Superga, a few miles to the east of the city, and crowned by
a sumptuous church, may be enjoyed one of the finest panoramas of the Italian
Alps. The numerous small towns in its vicinity, such as Moncalieri, Chieri, and
Carignano, abound in villas and participate in the prosperity of the capital. As
to the towns in the valley of the Tanaro, in the south, they form a group apart,
and are the natural intermediaries between the valley of the Po and the port of
Genoa. Alessandria, a strong fortress of hideous regularity, which has superseded
the old fortresses of Tortona and Novi, is the terminus of eight railways, and one
of the busiest places of Italy. The neighbouring cities of Asti, famous for its
sparkling wines, and Acqui, celebrated from the time of the Romans for its hot
springs, are likewise important for their commerce.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn71" id="fnanch71">71</a></p>

<p>Milan, the capital of Lombardy, is in every respect one of the leading cities of
Italy. In population it is inferior to Naples, in commerce
it is outstripped only <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
by Genoa, but in industry it is the equal of both. Its scientific and literary life
entitles it, probably, to the first rank amongst the cities between the Alps and Sicily.
In the most remote times Milan was an important town of the Celts, and since
then the advantages of its position have given it the preponderance amongst all
other cities of Northern Italy. Its power during the Middle Ages gained it the
epithet of the “Second Rome.” At the close of the thirteenth century it had
200,000 inhabitants, whilst London had not then a sixth of that number. Milan
stood in want of water, for it was dependent upon the feeble stream of the Olona,
and its citizens created the Naviglio Grande and the Martesana, veritable rivers,
which furnish a quantity of water double that of the Seine at Paris during
summer. They likewise erected magnificent monuments, but most of these have
perished during innumerable wars, and the aspect of Milan is now that of a
modern town of Western Europe. Its most famous building, the “Duomo,” with
its prodigious crowd of statues, its finely chiselled marbles and granites, must be
looked upon as a marvel of architecture, though from an artistic point of view it is
hardly more than an elaborately carved trinket out of all proportion. The stones
for this edifice were quarried on the Lago Maggiore, near the mouth of the Toce.</p>

<p>The capital of Lombardy, proud of the past and confident of the future, boasts
of never yielding servilely to impulses given from beyond. It has its own opinions,
manners, and fashions, and anything accepted from abroad is moulded in accordance
with local traditions. The other towns of Lombardy likewise maintain their
local character, are proud of their traditions, and glory in the annals of the past.
Como, on the beautiful lake named after it, the ancient rival of Milan, gains
wealth by spinning silk and exporting the agricultural produce of the Brianza.
Monza, surrounded by parks and villas, is the coronation city. Pavia, with its
525 towers, now in ruins, remembers the time when it was the residence of
the Lombard kings, and proudly points to the university, one of the oldest in
Europe, and to the Certosa (Chartreuse), one of the most sumptuous monasteries
of Italy. Vigevano, on the other side of the Ticino, rejoices in a fine castle. Lodi,
in the eleventh century, was the most powerful city of Italy next to Milan, and
carried on a war of extermination with the latter; it is still a busy place.
Cremona, an old republic, boasts of its <i>torrazzo</i>, or tower, 393 feet in height, the
loftiest in Europe until Gothic cathedrals were built. Bergamo, on a hill commanding
the rich plains of Brembo and Serio, produced a larger number of great
men than any other town except Florence; and Brescia, the armourers’ town,
more haughty still, proclaims herself to be the mother of heroes.</p>

<p>Mantua, on the Mincio, is one of the fortresses of the Quadrilateral, and can
hardly be said to belong to Lombardy, though included within its political boundaries.
It is essentially a military town. It has lost much of its old commerce,
though Jews are more plentiful there than in any other inland city of Italy. Its
swamps, woods, rice-fields, ditches, and fortified canals are productive of a degree
of humidity exceptional even in Lombardy, and the inhabitants consequently
eschew this ancient birthplace of Virgil. Strikingly different is the character of
the towns situated in the heart of the mountains, such as Sondrio, the
capital of the <span class="xxpn" id="p227">{227}</span>
Val Tellina, or delightful Salo, on the Lake of Garda, with its group of villas
scattered amongst groves of orange-trees.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn72" id="fnanch72">72</a></p>

<p>The physiognomy of the large towns of Emilia, beyond the Po, offers far fewer
peculiarities, for, as most of them are situated along the great Emilian highway,
they have been exposed for ages to the levelling influences of travelling merchants
and soldiers. Piacenza, a sorry place as a fortress, carries on an important commerce.
Parma, an old ducal residence, has a rich library, a museum, and
wonderful frescoes by Correggio in its churches.
Reggio, another important <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
station on the Emilian highway, is famous as the birthplace of Ariosto. Modena
has its museum, and the precious collection of books and manuscripts known as the
<i>Biblioteca Estense</i>. Bologna the “Learned,” which has taken the word “Libertas”
for its motto, still remains one of the most interesting of Italian cities. There are
its Etruscan cemetery, its palaces and mediæval buildings, and its two leaning
towers, which will most certainly come down in the end. Bologna is one of the
great railway centres, carries on much commerce, and increases rapidly in population.
It would have made a far better capital than Rome. Of late years the
environs of the city have been frequently flooded by the Reno, and these disasters
have cost Bologna its ancient epithet of “the Fat.”</p>

<p>Near this bustling place there are others, now stagnant, which can point only
to buildings in proof that they, too, were once flourishing. Ferrara, the ancient
capital of the Estes, has fallen from its high estate since the Po has deserted it,
but still remains a place of some importance. Ravenna has not been deserted by
the Po, but by the sea, with which it communicates now by a canal seven miles
in length, and navigable for ships drawing thirteen feet of water. The town
became the capital of Honorius and Theoderic the Goth, on account of the protection
offered by the surrounding marshes. To the exarchs it is indebted for its
curious Byzantine edifices, so rich in mosaics. As to the ancient Etruscan city of
Adria, on Venetian soil, to the north of the Po, it could hardly have claimed at
any period during the last two thousand years to give a name to the neighbouring
sea. It lies now at a distance of fourteen miles from it, and even in the time of
the Romans it must have been surrounded by lagoons or swamps, for how else can
we explain its epithet of “Town of the Seven Seas?” Porto, at the foot of the
Euganean Hills, may owe its name to an ancient lake or river.</p>

<p>Towns famous on account of their history, and still populous, are most crowded
together in the southern angle of the plain, usually known as the Romagna. The
towers and crenellated walls of Imola rise there on the banks of the Santerno.
Lugo, the “town of the beautiful Romagnese,” occupies the centre of the district
of Ravenna, and has much trade. Faenza, on the Emilian Road, is a large village
rather than a town, though it has given its name to a particular kind of porcelain
(faience). Forli is, next to Bologna, the most populous city of Romagna. Cesena
is known for the excellence of the hemp grown in the neighbourhood. Rimini,
where the Emilian Road reaches the sea, still has a few Roman ruins, including a
triumphal arch. The inhabitants of the Romagna are distinguished by great
energy. Their passions are violent, and as frequently lead them into crime as to
deeds of heroism.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn73" id="fnanch73">73</a></p>

<p>In Venetia there are several provincial towns of importance. Padua abounds
in monuments of art, possesses a university, and was formerly the rival of Venice.
Vicenza is embellished by the palaces erected by Palladio. Treviso and Belluno
are towns of some importance, the one on the Sile, the
other in the upper valley <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span>
of the Piave. At Udine is pointed out a mound of earth said to have been
thrown up by Attila, from which he contemplated the conflagration of Aquileja.
Palmanova, on the Austrian frontier, is a regularly built fortress. Verona, at the
other extremity of Venetia, has played an important part in the history of Italy,
but its commerce and industry have fallen into decay. It hardly fills up the space
enclosed by walls and bastions, and its present population is quite out of proportion
to the multitude of its public buildings dating from the Middle Ages, and
the dimensions of its Roman amphitheatre, capable of seating 50,000 spectators.
Amongst all the cities of Venetia it is Venice itself, the “Queen of the Adriatic,”
which has suffered least in the course of ages.</p>

<p>Venice is a very an­cient ci­ty. The re­mains of Ro­man build­ings
dis­cov­ered on the is­land of San Giorgia, far be­low the pre­sent level
of the sea, and there­fore re­ferred to in proof of the slow sub­si­dence
of the Venetian coast, prove to us that the mud islands of the gulf
sup­ported a pop­u­la­tion long before the in­va­sion of the Bar­barians.
These half-drowned lands may have at­tracted the coast pop­u­la­tion at
an early age, for they afforded security against attack, and offered
great advantages for carrying on commerce. Nevertheless, the Venice
of our time only dates from the commencement of the ninth century,
when the government of this maritime republic was established upon the
islands separated from the sea by the <i>lidi</i>, and from the mainland
by estuaries and swamps. This unique position rendered Venice almost
impregnable; and whilst the rest of Europe was being desolated by war,
Venice sent forth its commercial and warlike expeditions to every part
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, established factories, and built fortresses. Not
without arduous struggles, it became the most powerful and wealthiest
of the commercial republics of Italy. It was largely indebted for
this success to its favourable geographical position, almost in the
centre of the mediæval world. Its commerce brought the Venetians into
contact with nearly every nation, and they had no prejudices against
foreigners. The Armenians were admitted to their city, and an alliance
was made even with the Turks. At the time of the Crusades the Venetian
Republic occupied the foremost position amongst the states of Europe,
and its ambassadors enjoyed a vast amount of influence. This influence
was sustained by enormous material forces. Venice had a navy of 300
vessels, manned by 36,000 sailors, and the riches of the world, whether
obtained by legitimate commerce or by violence, were accumulated in its
2,000 palaces and 200 churches. Even <i>one</i> of the islets upon which
the city is built would have purchased a kingdom of Asia or Africa.
One of the most sumptuous cities of the West had <span class="xxpn"
id="p230">{230}</span> arisen upon banks of mud, inhabited formerly
only by poor fishermen. The larch forests of Dalmatia had been cut
down, and converted into piles upon which to build palaces. More than
400 bridges of marble joined island to island, and superb embankments
of granite defended this marvellous city against the encroachments of
the sea. Great achievements in the arts contributed their share in
making <i>Venezia la Bella</i> a city without its equal.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<p>But geographical discoveries, in which Venice itself took a leading share,
undermined the power of the Italian Republic. When Africa had been circumnavigated
and the New World discovered, the Me­di­ter­ra­nean ceased to be the
great commercial sea of the world. Venice was doomed to die. It no longer
monopolized the road to India, and the increasing power of the Turks crippled its
Eastern trade. Still, so great were its resources, that it maintained its independence
for more than three hundred years after it had lost its factories, and
only fell when shamefully deserted by General Bonaparte, its supposed ally.</p>

<p>The decadence of Venice was most remarkable during the dominion of Austria.
In 1840 the city had less than 100,000 inhabitants, hundreds of its palaces were
in ruins, the grass grew in its squares, and seaweeds encumbered its landing-places.
Since that time it has been gradually recovering. A bridge of 222 arches
and 2,000 feet in length connects it with the mainland, and its commerce, though
not equal to that of Trieste, is nevertheless of considerable importance.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn74" id="fnanch74">74</a> The
manufacture of looking-glasses, lace, and other articles has imparted fresh life to
Venice, and there, as well as in other towns of the lagoons (Malamocco, Burano,
Murano, and Chioggia), thousands of workmen are busy in the production of
those gay-looking glass beads which find their way into every part of the world,
and which in certain countries of the East and in Central Africa take the place
of coin. But Venice, though less populous and active than of yore, still rejoices
in its delightful climate and its bright skies. Its gaiety and fêtes are not yet
things of the past, and its palaces, built in a style half Italian, half Moorish, still
contain the priceless masterpieces of Titian, Tintoretto, and Paul Veronese.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn75" id="fnanch75">75</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">Liguria
is but a narrow slip of land if we compare it with the broad plain of
the Po, but it is one of the most clearly defined districts of Europe, and its inhabitants
have retained many original traits. The contrast between the Podane plains
and the littoral region beyond the barren Apennines is striking, but if we
travel in the direction of Provence or of Tuscany the landscape changes only
by degrees. The rampart of the Apennines surrounds the
whole of the Gulf of <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
Genoa, and there is not a single break in it. These mountains are very different in
character from the Alps, though joined to them as the branch of a tree is united to
its trunk. It is not possible to tell where one chain ends and the other begins. If
the main direction of the mountain is to be the criterion, the Ligurian Apennines
may be said to begin at the frontier of France, near the sources of the Tinea and
Vesubio; but if great height, pastures, and perennial snow are considered sufficient
to constitute an Alpine region, then the Apennines only begin to the east of the
Col di Tenda, for the fine summits of the Clapier, Fenêtre, and Gordalesque, to the
west of that pass, attain a height of 10,000 feet. They are quite Alpine in their
character, and may boast even of small glaciers, the most southerly in the mountains
of Central Europe. Geologists usually draw the line where cretaceous and tertiary
rocks take the place of the crystalline rocks of the Alps. But this, too, is only a
conventional division, for these crystalline rocks, which constitute the crest of the
Alps in the west, extend far to the east, and occasionally they break through the
sedimentary formations which overlie them, and rise into summits similar to those
of the Alps. Thus the granitic summits of the mountains of Spezia remind us of
the mountain mass near the Col di Tenda.</p>

<p>The chain of the Ligurian Apennines is by no means of uniform height, but, like
that of the Alps, it consists of mountain masses separated by passes. The lowest of
these passes is that to the west of Savona, named indifferently after one of the
neighbouring villages, Altare, Carcara, or Cadibona. This pass is hardly more
than 1,600 feet in height, and is popularly looked upon as constituting the boundary
between the Alps and Apennines. The possession of this pass
during war has <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
always been considered of great importance, for it commands the approaches to
Genoa and the upper valleys of Piemont, and the Tanaro and Bormido, which rise
near it, have often run with blood.</p>

<p>The Apennines to the east of this pass have an average height of 3,300 feet, and
beyond the Pass of Giovi (1,538 feet), through which the road leads from Genoa to
the northern plains, many summits attain a height of 4,500 feet. Several spurs,
abounding in ravines, extend here to the north. The main chain, at the same time,
retires from the coast, and the Pass of Pontremoli, which separates the Ligurian
from the Tuscan Apennines, and through which leads the road from Parma to
Spezia, is no less than thirty miles from the sea. In this eastern portion of the
Genoese Apennines a spur detaches itself from the main chain, and terminates in the
fine promontory of Porto Venere, a magnificent rock of black marble, surmounted
formerly by a temple of Venus. This spur, which protects the Gulf of Spezia
against westerly winds, has at all times constituted an obstacle to the intercourse
between neighbouring peoples, not so much on account of its height, but because
of its steepness. In some places the crest of the Apennines is hardly more than
four miles from the sea. The slope, in such places, is exceedingly steep, and roads
can ascend it only in numerous windings.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn77" id="fnanch77">77</a></p>

<p>The small width of the maritime slope of the Ligurian Apennines accounts for
the absence of perennial rivers. The most considerable streams to the east of the
Roya, which runs for the greater part through French territory, such as the Taggia
or the Centa, only assume the appearance of rivers when the snows melt, or after
heavy rains. Ordinarily they are but small streams, closed at the mouth by bars
of pebbles. Between Albenga and Spezia, for a distance of 160 miles, there are
only torrents, and in order to meet again with a real river we must go beyond the
Gulf of Spezia. This river is the Magra, which separates Liguria from Etruria,
and which, up to the epoch of Augustus, formed the boundary of Italy. Its
alluvium has converted an ancient bay of the sea into a lake, and formed a beach,
1,300 yards in width, in front of the ancient Tyrrhenian city of Luni, which
formerly stood on the seashore.</p>

<p>The want of great rivers in Liguria is compensated for to some extent by subterranean
water-courses. Several springs rise from the bottom of the sea, at some
distance from the shore. The springs of La Polla, in the Gulf of Spezia, are amongst
the most bountiful amongst them. They have been isolated by the Italian Government
from the surrounding salt water, and their water is supplied to ships.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of rivers, the sterility of the soil, and the steep escarpments,
this portion of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean coast region contrasts strikingly with other parts
of temperate Europe. Having reached the summit of the mountains beyond the
magnificent chestnut forests at the head-streams of the Ellero, the Tanaro, and the
Bormida, we look down upon a scene almost African in its character. Scarcely a
blade of grass is to be seen between Nice and Spezia, and only the grass-plots, kept
up at great expense in some pleasure-gardens, remind us
that Piemont and <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
Lombardy are near at hand. Pines and brambles would have remained the only
verdure in these Ligurian valleys and ravines if it were not for the transformation
wrought by gardeners and agriculturists. Strange to say, trees do not ascend to
the same height on the slopes of the Apennines as in the Alps, though the mean
temperature is far higher, and at an altitude at which the beech still attains noble
proportions in Switzerland we find it here stunted in growth. Larches are hardly
ever seen.</p>

<p>The sea is as sterile as the land. There are neither shallows, islands, nor seaweeds
affording shelter to fish. The cliffs descend precipitously into the sea, and
the narrow strips of beach, extending from promontory to promontory, consist only
of sand without the admixture of a single shell. The Genoese fishermen, therefore,
resort to distant coasts, those of the “Ponente,” or west, going to Sicily, whilst
those of Camogli, on the Riviera di Levanto, visit the coasts of Tuscany. This
sterility of land and sea accounts for the large number of Genoese met with in
other parts of the world.</p>

<p>But though an unfruitful country, Liguria is exceedingly picturesque. A
traveller availing himself of the railway between Nice and Genoa, which follows
the sinuosities of the coast and pierces the promontories in numerous tunnels, is
brought within reach of the most varied scenery. At one time the line runs close
to the beach, with the foam of the sea almost touching the track on the one side,
while tamarisks bearing pink blossoms overshadow it from the other. Elsewhere
we creep up the steep slope, and obtain a view of the cultivated terraces raised at
immense labour by the peasantry, whilst the bluish sea is seen afar to the right,
almost hidden by a grove of olive-trees, and stretching away until lost in the direction
of Corsica. Towns, villages, old towers, villas, ship-yards, and other industrial
establishments impart an almost infinite variety to the scenery. One town occupies
the top of a hill, and, seen from below, its old walls and towers stand out boldly
against the sky; another is built am­phi­thea­tri­cal­ly, close to the strand upon which
the fishermen have drawn their boats; a third is hidden in a hollow, and surrounded
by vines, olive, orange, and lemon trees. A date-tree here and there
imparts an oriental aspect to the landscape. Bordighera, a small place close
to the French frontier, is quite surrounded by palm-trees, whose fruit, however,
but rarely ripens.</p>

<p>The climate of Albenga, Loana, and some other places on the Genoese coast is
far from salubrious, on account of the miasmata exhaled by sheets of stagnant
water left behind by freshets. Even Genoa cannot boast of an agreeable climate,
not because there are marshes near it, but because the southerly winds charged
with moisture are caught there by the semicircle of mountains, and are made to
discharge their superabundant humidity. The number of rainy days at Genoa
averages 121 a year. There are, however, several towns along this coast protected
by the mountains against the north, and yet out of the usual track of the moisture-laden
southerly winds, whose climate is exceptionally delightful.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn78" id="fnanch78">78</a> Bordighera <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
and San Remo, near the French frontier, are the rivals of Mentone as regards
climate; and Nervi, to the east of Genoa, is likewise a favourite place of resort, on
account of its clear sky and pure atmosphere. Villas and castles rise on every
promontory and in every valley of these favoured districts. For a dozen miles
on either side of Genoa the coast is lined by villas. The population of the city
has overflowed the walls which once confined it, and is establishing itself in populous
suburbs. The long street which winds between factories and gardens, scales
promontories, and descends into valleys, will continue to grow in length until it
extends along the whole coast of Liguria, for the charms of the country attract
men of leisure from every quarter of Europe.</p>

<p>The historical development of the ancient Ligurians, who were probably of
Iberian race, was largely influenced by the nature of the country they
inhabited. The cultivable land being only of small extent, the superabundant
population was forced to look to the sea for a livelihood, and engaged in navigation
and commerce. Antium, the modern Genoa, was an “emporium” of the Ligurians
ever since the time of the Romans, and its vessels frequented every corner of
the Tyrrhenian Sea. In the Middle Ages the Genoese flag was carried into every
part of the known world, and it was Genoa that gave birth to Christopher Columbus,
whose name is inscribed upon the first page of modern history as the discoverer of
America. It was a Genoese, too, Giovanni Gabotto, or Cabot, who afresh discovered
the coast of North America five centuries after its original
discovery by the <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span>
Normans. The hardy mariners of Genoa have thus navigated the seas from the
most remote times. Even now they almost monopolize the navigation of the great
rivers of the Argentine Republic. The Genoese likewise enjoy a high reputation
as gardeners, and are met with in every large town of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.</p>

<p>As long as the Apennines were not crossed by practicable carriage roads,
Genoa possessed no advantages whatever over the other ports of Liguria, but ever
since it has been placed in easy communication with the fertile plains of
Lombardy and Piemont, the great advantages of its geographical position have
told upon its development. Pisa was the only republic on the western coast of
Italy which contested this superiority of Genoa, but was defeated after a sanguinary
struggle. The Genoese possessed themselves of Corsica, the inhabitants of which
were treated most cruelly; they took Minorca from the Moors, and even captured
several towns in Spain, which they restored only after important commercial
privileges had been granted them. In the Ægean Sea the nobles of Genoa
became the proprietors of Chios, Lesbos, Lemnos, and other islands. At Constantinople
the Genoese merchants were as powerful almost as the
Emperor. Kaffa, in <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
the Crimea, was one of their wealthy colonies. Their factories and towers were
met along every commercial high-road in Asia Minor, and even in the recesses of the
Caucasus. The possession of the Black Sea gave them the command of the trade
with Central Asia. These distant colonies explain the use of a few Arab,
Turkish, and Greek terms by the Genoese, and though the dialect spoken by
them is decidedly Italian, the intonation is French.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Genoa, though more powerful than Pisa, failed in wresting the
command of the sea from the Venetians, who enjoyed immense advantages
through their connection with Germany. Her political influence has never
equalled that of Venice, nor has she produced as many men eminent in literature
and art as has her Adriatic rival. The Genoese had the reputation in former
times of being violent and false, fond of luxury and power, and indifferent to
everything which did not enrich them. “A sea without fish, mountains without
forests, men without faith, women without modesty—thus is Genoa,” was a
proverb ever in the mouth of the enemies of the Ligurian city. The dissensions
amongst the noble families of Genoa were incessant, but the Bank of St. George
never allowed civil strife to interfere with business. Wealth flowed into the city
without any cessation, and enabled its citizens to construct those palaces, marble
arcades, and hanging gardens which have won for it the epithet of <i>la Superba</i>. In
the end, however, ruin overtook the Bank, and that justly, for it had supplied
princes with money to enable them to wage war, and its bankruptcy in the middle
of the eighteenth century rendered Genoa politically impotent.</p>

<p>The capital of Liguria, in spite of its small extent, its sinuous streets, its ramparts,
stairs, and dirty narrow quays, may justly boast of palaces equally remarkable for
the splendour and originality of their architecture. Many of these magnificent
buildings appeared to be doomed to ruin during the decay of the town, but, on the
return of more prosperous times, the citizens again devoted themselves to the
embellishment of their city. Genoa is the busiest port of Italy.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn79" id="fnanch79">79</a> Its shipowners
possess nearly half the Italian mercantile marine, and three-fourths of the vessels
annually built in Italy are furnished from its ship-yards. The harbour, though
320 acres in extent, no longer suffices for the hundreds of sailing vessels and
steamers which crowd into it. Nor is it sufficiently sheltered against the winds,
and it has therefore been proposed to construct a vast breakwater far beyond its
present limits. Genoa fancies that its interests are not sufficiently attended to by
the Central Government. A second railway across the Apennines is urgently
demanded, in order to manage the traffic that will be created by the opening of
the direct railway through Switzerland, which will place Genoa in direct communication
with Western Germany.</p>

<p>In the meantime Genoa is expanding in all directions. Its factories of macaroni,
paper, silks and velvets, soap, oil, jewellery, metal-work, pottery, ornamental
flowers, and other objects are ever increasing; and <i>ovrar del
Genoes</i>—Genoese <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
industry—is a marvel now, as it was in the Middle Ages. San Pier d’Arena
(Sampierdarena), to the west, has become a veritable manufacturing town. Cornigliano,
Rivarolo, Sestri di Ponente with its large ship-yards, Pegli, and Voltri are
populous towns, having spinning-mills and foundries. Savona,
whose port was <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
filled up by the jealous Genoese, occupies the bottom of a vast bay. It has glass-works
and potteries, and is connected by a railway with Turin. Elsewhere on the
Riviera di Ponente the towns are crowded closely together. Such is the case with
the twin cities of Oneglia and Porto Maurizio, the one built on the beach, the other
on a steep hill close by, and known as the “Fountains of Oil,” because of their
extensive plantations of olives. At San Remo, however, olives are more plentiful
still.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn80" id="fnanch80">80</a></p>

<p>On the Riviera di Levante town joins town like pearls in a necklace. Albaro,
with its charming mansion, Quarto, whence departed the expedition which took
Sicily from the Bourbons, and Nervi, a health resort for persons suffering from
pulmonary diseases, constitute a long-stretching suburb of Genoa, extending in the
direction of Recco and Camogli, two towns abounding in shipping. The rocky
promontory of Porto Fino, thus named after the dolphins which formerly frequented
it, imposes an insurmountable obstacle to the further extension of Genoa
in this direction. Having traversed the tunnel leading through this promontory,
we reach another group of towns, viz. Rapallo, the industrious; Chiavari, a great
place of trade; Lavagna, with its famous quarries of grey slates; and Sestri di
Levante, a town of fishermen.</p>

<p>The coast beyond Sestri is but sparsely inhabited, for there bold cliffs approach
the sea; but having doubled the superb cape of Porto Venere, we enter the fine
Gulf of Spezia,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn81" id="fnanch81">81</a> with its numerous forts, ship-yards, arsenals, and other buildings.
The Italian Government has been busy ever since 1861 in converting this
gulf into a first-rate naval arsenal, but no sooner has a portion of the work been
completed than the progress made in the arts of destruction compels the engineers
to remodel it—a very costly task. Whatever future may be in store for
Spezia as a military port, it has none as a commercial one, for though it affords
excellent shelter to vessels, no railway connects it with the fertile countries beyond
the Apennines, and its exports are limited to the produce of the valleys in its
immediate vicinity. Spezia is indebted for its high rank amongst the cities of
Italy to its beautiful gulf, the rival of the Bay of Naples and the roadstead of
Palermo. From the summit of the marble hill above the decayed town of Porto
Venere we look down upon a marvellous succession of bays and promontories, and
far in the distance the mountains of Corsica rise indistinctly above the blue waters.
Looking to the east, we behold the picturesque towns on the opposite side of
the gulf embedded in groves of olive-trees and cypresses, the Apuanic Alps
and the Apennines bounding the horizon. Right opposite is the charming
town of Lerici, and to the south of it the shore upon which Byron reduced to
ashes the body of his friend Shelley: no spot more appropriate for this mournful
holocaust. <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 title="IV.—Tuscany.">IV.—<span class="smcap">T<b>USCANY.</b></span></h3></div>

<p class="pfirst">Tuscany,
like Liguria, lies on the southern slope of the Apennines, but is of far
greater width, for that back-bone of Italy retreats there from the Gulf of Genoa,
and stretches right across the broadest part of the peninsula to the Adriatic.
Besides this there are several detached plateaux and mountain ranges to the south
of the valley of the Arno.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn82" id="fnanch82">82</a></p>

<p>The Apennines of Tuscany are of very unequal height, and they are traversed
by numerous low passes, which could easily be converted into carriage roads.
Speaking generally, they consist of a series of elongated and parallel mountain
masses, separated from each other by valleys, through which flow the head-streams
of the Serchio and the Arno. The first important mountain mass of the main
chain near the frontiers of Liguria, which is commanded by the Orsajo and Succiso,
is thus separated by the valley of the Magra from the parallel range of Lumigiana.
The chain of Garfognana, to the north of the plains of Lucca, has for its pendant
the Alps of Apuana. Monte Cimone, farther east, and the other summits of the
<i>Alpe Apennina</i> to the north of Pistoja and Prato, are attended by the parallel
ridges of the Monti Catini and Monte Albano, on whose slope is the famous grotto
of Monsummano, with a thermal spring. A fourth mountain mass, that which the
direct road from Florence to Bologna crosses in the Pass of Futa, has likewise its
lateral chains, viz. the Monte Mugello, to the south of the Sieve; the Prato Magno,
encircled by the Upper Arno; and the Alps of Catenaja, between the Arno and the
Tiber.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn83" id="fnanch83">83</a></p>

<p>The Apennines of Tuscany in many places attain a height of 5,000 feet, and are
quite Alpine in their aspect, the upper slopes remaining covered with snow for
more than half the year. They owe much of their grandeur to the precipitous slopes
and fantastic profiles of the calcareous rocks which enter so largely into their composition.
The forests of chestnuts, firs, and beeches which formerly clothed the
whole of the range have not yet been entirely destroyed. The beautiful woods
which cover the slopes of Prato Magno have impressed the mind of many a
poet; and, since Milton sang the delights of Vallombrosa, the “shaded vale”
has become a proverbial name for everything sweet and touching in the poetry of
nature. Farther to the west the monastery of the Campo di Maldulo (Camaldoli)
occupies one of the most beauteous spots in all Italy, the woods and meadows of
which have been celebrated by Ariosto. From the summit above the convent both
the “Tuscan and the Slavonian Sea” can be seen, as that poet tells us.</p>

<p>The barren escarpments and forests of the Apennines form a charming contrast
to the valleys and rounded hills of Lower Tuscany, where
nearly every height is <span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span>
surmounted by the ruins of a mediæval castle; graceful villas are scattered over the
verdant slopes, farmhouses stand in the midst of vineyards and pointed cypresses,
and every cultivable spot is made to yield a rich harvest. Historical associations,
the taste of its inhabitants, the fertility of the soil, an abundance of running water,
and the sweetness of the climate all combine in making Central Tuscany one
of the most privileged regions of Italy. Protected by the rampart of the Apennines
against cold northerly winds, this region faces the Tyrrhenian Sea, whence
blow warm and humid winds of tropical origin. The rains they bring are not
excessive, thanks to the screen formed by the mountains of Corsica and Sardinia,
and the happy disposition of the detached hills near the coast. The climate of
Tuscany is essentially temperate, and to its equability, no less than to the natural
beauty of their abode, the Tuscans owe, no doubt, much of their gaiety, their good-nature,
fine taste, poetical feeling, and facile imagination.</p>

<p>The valley of the Arno completely separates the hills of Southern Tuscany,
usually known as the “Sub-Apennines,” from the principal chain of the mountains.
This valley, with its defiles and ancient lake basins, may be likened
to a moat <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
bounding the wall of the Apennines. The vale of Chiana, originally an arm of the
sea, and then a lake, forms the uppermost portion of the zone which separates the
Apennines from the hills of Southern Tuscany. Then follows the Campagna of
Florence, an ancient lake basin, which it would be easy to flood again by building
a dam across the defile of the Golfolina, through which the river makes its escape,
and which was rent asunder by the “Egyptian Hercules.” Castruccio, the famous
commander of the Luccans, actually proposed to flood the plains of Florence in the
fourteenth century by constructing a dam across this defile; but happily his
engineers pronounced the scheme to be impracticable, for they supposed the
difference of level to amount to 288 feet, whilst in reality it is only fifty.</p>

<p>The Sub-Apennine hills to the south of the Arno are of rounded contours, of a
gloomy grey colour, and devoid of all verdure. Whilst the Apennines consist exclusively
of Jurassic and cretaceous rocks, the Sub-Apennines are of tertiary formation,
their sandstones, clays, marls, and pudding-stones being pierced here and there by
serpentine. Well-defined ranges can hardly be said to exist. Southern Tuscany,
indeed, may be described as a table-land intersected by rivers in all directions, surmounted
by irregular groups of hills, and pierced by “sinks,” which swallow up
some of the rivers. The cavities of the Ingolla form one of these sinks, in which
several rivulets lose themselves, to reappear lower down as the source of the Elsa
Viva, one of the principal tributaries of the Arno. The most elevated hills of this
Sub-Apennine region form the water-parting between the Arno, the Cecina, and the
Ombrone, and in the Poggio di Montieri, a mountain abounding in copper, they
attain an elevation of 3,323 feet. The Labbro (3,815 feet), Cetona (3,650 feet), and
Monte Amiata (5,450 feet), to the south of the Ombrone valley, rise to a greater
height, but geologically they belong already to Central Italy. The Cetona is a
Jurassic outlier surrounded by recent formations. Monte Amiata, a trachytic cone,
is the most elevated volcano of continental Italy. It no longer vomits lava, but
numerous hot springs and solfataras prove that the volcanic forces are not yet quite
extinct. The Radicofani (2,950 feet) is likewise an extinct volcano, whose lava
resembles petrified froth, and can be cut with a hatchet.</p>

<p>Subterranean agencies must indeed be very active in
Tuscany, for metalliferous <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
veins ramify in all directions, and the number of mineral springs of every description
is larger than in any other part of Italy. Amongst these springs there are
several of world-wide reputation, as, for instance, those of Monte Catini, of San
Giuliano, and of the Bagni di Lucca. The brine springs of Tuscany are very
productive; but the most curious, and at the same time most useful, springs of all
are the famous <i>lagoni</i>, in a side valley of the Cecina, and at the northern foot of the
Poggio di Montieri. From a distance dense clouds of white vapour are seen rolling
over the plain, and the bubbling noise made by gases escaping through the
ponds, or <i>lagoni</i>, is heard. These ponds contain various salts, silica, and boracic
acid, which is of great value in the manufacture of china and glass, and yields a
considerable revenue to Tuscany. Nowhere else in Europe, except, perhaps, in
the crater of the Eolian Vulcano, is boracic acid met with in sufficient quantities
to repay the labour of extracting it. In Tuscany, however, there are several other
localities where it might be won with advantage, as, for instance, near Massa
Maritima, to the south of the Montieri.</p>

<p>The subterranean fermentation of which Tuscany is the scene is no doubt due
in a large measure to the changes which have taken place in the relative proportions
of land and sea. Several isolated hills rise near the coast like islands from
the sea, and these have evidently been joined to the mainland by the alluvial
deposits brought down by the rivers. The Monti Serra (3,000 feet), to the east of
Pisa, between the Arno and the Serchio, are almost insulated even now, for they
are surrounded by swamps, and the level of the Lake of Bientina, at their eastern
foot, is scarcely thirty feet above that of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. The heights along
the coast to the south of Leghorn are not quite so isolated, but the lowland which
connects them with the table-land of the interior is only of small elevation. The
promontory, however, whose extremities are occupied by the towns of Populonia
and Piombino (653 feet), is joined to the mainland only by a low plain of sand.
The most perfect type of these ancient islands is presented to us in the superb
Monte Argentaro, at the southern extremity of the Tuscan littoral, which rises
boldly from the sea to a height of 2,085 feet, and is attached to the mainland by
two narrow strips of land covered with pine-trees, enclosing a lake of regular
shape: in the midst of it, on a fragment of the ancient beach, is built
the town of Orbetello. This lake, which looks almost as if it were the work
of a generation of giants, has been converted into an eel-pond, and millions of fish
are caught in it every year. Towards the west of this mountain, in the direction
of Corsica, lie the islands of Giglio and Monte Cristo (2,062 feet) and the rock
of Formica. The island of Elba, farther north, forms a small world of its own.</p>

<p>The rivers of Tuscany have wrought great changes in the plains through which
they flow, and along the sea-coast. Their labour has been facilitated by the nature
of the soil which they traverse. The least rain converts the barren hill-slopes
into a semi-fluid paste, which is carried by the rivers down to the sea. The
mouth of the Arno has thus been pushed forward to the extent of seven miles in
the course of a few centuries. In former times the Serchio and the Arno united
before they flowed into the sea, but the Pisans diverted the former
river to the <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
north, in order to rid themselves of its unwelcome deposits. Pisa, in the time of
Strabo, stood at a distance of only twenty Olympian stadia from the Tyrrhenian
Sea, and when the <i>cascina</i> of San Rossore was built, towards the close of the eleventh
century, its walls were close to the beach, which is now at a distance of three
miles. Extensive plains intersected by dunes, or <i>tomboli</i>, and partly covered with
forests of pines, have been added to the land in the course of centuries. These
sandy wastes have become the home of large herds of horses and half-wild cattle,
and the camel has been acclimatised there, it is said, since the Crusades. These
changes in the coast-line may not, however, be due exclusively to the agency of
the rivers, for there exists evidence of an upheaval of the land. The building
stone known at Leghorn as <i>panchina</i> is clearly of marine origin, and the shells
which enter into its composition are still met with in the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p>

<p>Amongst the changes effected by human agency in the basin of the Arno
those referring to the Val di Chiana are, perhaps, the most important. This
depression connects the basins of the Arno and Tiber, and may possibly have served
as an outlet to the former river before it had opened itself a
way through the <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
gorge below Florence. Formerly the water-parting between the two rivers was
close to the Arno. A small portion of its drainage was carried to the Tuscan
river, but by far the greater portion of the vale was occupied by stagnant pools,
extending to the south as far as the latitude of Montepulciano, a distance of twenty
miles. The whole of this region was a breeding-place of fever. Dante and other
Italian writers speak of it as an accursed place. The inhabitants made vain
attempts at drainage. The illustrious Galileo, when consulted
on the subject, <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span>
declared that nothing could be done to mend this evil; and though Torricelli
conceived that it would be possible to drain the valley, he took no steps to put his
theories into practice.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century the work of drainage was at
length seriously taken in hand, directed by Fossombroni, the celebrated engineer.
“Warps,” or <i>colmate</i>, were thrown up at the outlet of each lateral ravine between
which the débris carried down from the flanks of the mountains was deposited.
The swamps gradually filled up, and the soil became firm. By constructing
a dam (<i>argine</i>) across the vale at the point chosen for the new water-parting,
an outfall was created, and a line of stagnant swamps was thus converted into
a pure rivulet. The valley, at one time a hotbed of fever, has now become one of
the most salubrious districts of Italy. The newly won lands were at once taken
possession of by agriculturists, and 500 square miles were thus added to the productive
area of Tuscany. Villages, formerly inhabited by fever-stricken wretches,
have become wealthy towns, and the success of this <i>bonification</i>, or reclamation,
has been thorough. The torrents are under control now, and have already
deposited 17,650 million cubic feet of alluvium over an area of 50,000 acres, as if
they were intelligent workmen. The same system of drainage has been successfully
applied in other parts of Italy, and particularly near Grosseto, on the right
bank of the Ombrone.</p>

<p>Amongst the great drainage works which will evermore contribute to the glory
of Tuscan engineers, the innumerable canals draining the
plains of Fucecchio, <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
Pontedera, Pisa, Lucca, Leghorn, and Viareggio, each of which was formerly
occupied by its lake, deserve to be noticed. One of the most difficult of these
lakes is that of Bientina, or Sesto, to the east of the Pisan hills, which is supposed
to have been formed by an overflow of the Serchio. In former times this lake had
two effluents, one running north to the Serchio, the other south to the Arno. The
outfall left nothing to be desired in ordinary times, but after heavy rains the two
effluents were converted into inflowing rivers, and if the sluices had not been
closed, the Arno and the Serchio would have rejoined each other in this inland sea.
The Bientina, during such freshets, covered six times its ordinary area, and in
order to save the fertile fields of Tuscany it became absolutely necessary to create
a third effluent. The engineers conceived the happy idea of conveying this new
effluent through a tunnel, passing beneath the Arno, three feet in width, into an
ancient bed of that river, now supplanted by the Colombrone.</p>

<p>In most of these enterprises it was necessary to struggle on in spite of the
miasmatic atmosphere, which hung more particularly over the littoral zone,
where the fresh inland water mingles with the salt water of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.
The blending of the two waters destroyed the fresh-water plants and animals, and
the deleterious gases arising from their decomposition poisoned the atmosphere.
About the middle of last century an engineer, Zendrini, proposed to construct
sluices separating the fresh from the salt water. This was done, and the fevers at
once disappeared. In 1768, the sluices having been allowed to fall out of repair,
the miasmatic scourge immediately reappeared, and it was not until they had
been repaired that the sanitary condition of the villages along the coast was
improved. Twice since neglect to keep the sluices in a proper condition has
been punished with the same results; but from 1821 they have been maintained
in thorough order, and the sanitary condition of the country has ever since been
most satisfactory. Viareggio, in the centre of this malarial district, was up to
1740 hardly more than a hamlet, avoided on account of its insalubrity, but is now
a seaside town, the favourite resort of numbers of visitors.</p>

<p>Much has been done, no doubt, in draining the land, but there is still room
for many improvements. The Maremma, a track between Piombino and Orbetello,
remains one of the most insalubrious regions of Europe, in spite of what has been
done by sanitary engineers. The inhabitants never reach a high age, and
though they descend to the plain only when it is absolutely required for cultivating
their fields, they frequently carry away with them the germs of disease.
In the two summers of 1840 and 1841 no less than 36,000 persons suffered from
fever amongst a total population of 80,000 souls, most of whom reside in villages
built on hills, and only rarely visit the pestilential plain. In order to escape the
pernicious influence of the poisonous air, it is necessary to reside constantly at an
elevation of 325 feet above the sea, and even that does not always suffice, for
the episcopal city of Sovana is notoriously unhealthy, though built at that
height. Fevers occur frequently at a distance from the swamps, and Salvagnoli
Marchetti is of opinion that they are due to the nature of the soil. The malaria
is said to creep up clayey hills permeated by empyreumatic
substances; it likewise <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
poisons the air of districts abounding in saline springs, and still more that near
deposits of alum. Southerly winds are likewise most pernicious, and fevers
rise highest in the valleys which are exposed to them. Places, on the other
hand, which are fully open to the sea breeze are quite free from malaria, even
if swamps are near, as at Orbetello and Piombino.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the coasts of Etruria did not suffer from malaria
whilst the ancient Tyrrhenian cities were prosperous. The excavations made
recently in connection with the railways have revealed a complete system of
subterranean canals, which formerly drained the whole of the Maremmas.
Populonia and other large cities, of which only a few ruins are found now, could
certainly not have existed if the climate had been as unhealthy as at present.
The ancient Etruscans were famous as hydraulic engineers. They embanked
torrents, drained swamps, and rendered the country cultivable, but their engineering
works were allowed to decay soon after they had been subjected, and the country
returned to its primitive savageness. On the other hand, there
are many towns <span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span>
which were considered healthy during the Middle Ages, but are now desolated by
fever. Massa Maritima, to the south-west of the Moutieri mountain, was rich
and populous as long as it maintained its republican liberties; but no sooner had
it been enslaved by Pisans and Sienese than its drainage works were allowed to
fall into decay, and in the end it found itself reduced to the “shadow of a town.”
Sanitary works carried out recently have brought back some of its ancient prosperity.</p>

<p>Amongst the causes which have contributed most materially towards a
deterioration of the climate may be mentioned the destruction of the mountain
forests and the rapid increase of alluvial lands resulting from it. The monasteries
of Tuscany, which until quite recently were the owners of the fish-ponds in the
Maremmas, energetically protested against the construction of embankments or
other drainage works, which they conceived would interfere with their cherished
Lenten food. Several of the inland towns rejoiced in the possession of some
unhealthy swampy tract, to which obnoxious persons might be banished with a
certainty of their dying. Even the Kings of Spain established a penal establishment
at one of the most deadly spots on this coast, and banishment to Talamone,
at one time a flourishing port of the Republic of Siena, was tantamount to a
sentence of death.</p>

<p>Many attempts were made to reclaim these lands. Macchiavelli and other
statesmen of Tuscany thought that the former salubrity of the climate could be
restored by merely repeopling the country. Colonists were sent for from other
parts of Italy, and even from Greece and Germany, but they soon succumbed to
the climate. Since that time considerable progress has been made in rendering
these marshy districts more salubrious. Trees have been planted, and, in combination
with proper drainage, they have rendered many districts habitable which
were not so formerly. Populonia is a case in point. Follonica, where there are
furnaces in which the iron ores of Elba are smelted, is likewise looking up,
though its inhabitants still fly the place on the approach of the fever season.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The Etruscans, or Tyrrhenians, were the ancestors of the Tuscans, and long
before the dominion of the Romans they were the preponderating race of all
Italy. They occupied not only the whole of the southern slope of the Apennines
as far as the Tiber, but had also founded a confederation of twelve towns in the
Campagna, of which Capua was the head, and as traders and pirates they held
possession of the Tyrrhenian Sea, still named after them. The island of Capri
was one of their most advanced outposts towards the south. The Adriatic was
likewise their own, for Adria, Bologna (called Felsina by them), Ravenna, and
Mantua were Etruscan colonies, and the Rhætians in the Alpine valleys were their
allies, and perhaps kinsmen. But who were the Etruscans? They have been
classed with Aryans, Ugrians, and Semites; with Greeks, Germans, Scythians,
Egyptians, and Turks. The Etruscan inscriptions on ancient monuments, though
very legible, have not hitherto been deciphered satisfactorily. If Corssen’s interpretation
is accepted, their language resembled the Latin
tongues; but this <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>
philologist, after all, may not be entitled to be called the “Œdipus of the
Etruscan sphinx.”</p>

<p>The most common type of the Etruscans, as transmitted to us on cinerary
vases, is that of squat men, often inclining to obesity, with broad shoulders, prominent
face, curved noses, broad retreating forehead, dark complexion, dolichocephalous
skull, and curly hair. This type is neither Hellenic nor Italian.
Amongst their monuments there are none of those curious structures known as
<i>nuraghi</i>, which abound in Malta, Sardinia, and Pantellaria, but dolmens are
numerous. The sepulchral monuments, of which many thousands have already
been brought to light, prove that the arts had attained a high degree of development
in ancient Etruria. The paintings in the interior of the vaults, the bas-reliefs
on the sarcophagi, the vases, candelabra, pottery, and bronzes, resemble similar
work produced by the genius of Greek artists. The arrangement of their dwelling-houses,
though not devoid of originality, proves the intimate connection existing
between the civilisations of the Etruscans and early Greeks. It was the Etruscans
who initiated Rome into the arts. The <i>Cloaca Maxima</i>, the most ancient monument
of the Eternal City, the wall named after Servius Tullius, the Mamertine prison,
and, in fact, all the remains of the Rome of the kings, were their work. It was
they who erected the temples, supplied the statues to deities, built the dwelling-houses,
and furnished them with articles of ornament. Even the she-wolf of
bronze, now in the Capitoline Museum, and a symbol of the Roman people, appears
to be of Etruscan workmanship.</p>

<p>The Tuscans of our day differ, however, in many respects from their Etruscan
ancestors. These latter, to judge from the paintings in their sepulchral cities,
were an austere race. They appear, likewise, to have been a nation of cooks and
gluttons. Neither of these qualities can be laid to the charge of their descendants.
The modern Tuscan is of an amiable and kindly disposition, he is possessed
of wit and artistic tastes, easy to move, and altogether perhaps a trifle too
pliant of character. The Tuscans of the plain, but not those of the Maremmas,
are the most gentle of Italians; they “live and let live,” and are exceedingly
good-natured. A singular trait distinguishes them from the rest of the Italians:
though brave when carried away by passion, they turn with horror from a dead
body. In this we may trace the persistence of ancient superstitions, for though
the Tyrrhenians concealed their tombs, the worship of the dead was the most
prominent of their religious observances.</p>

<p>The modern Tuscans, like their ancestors, have known a time when they took
the lead amongst the people of Italy, and even now they stand at the head of the
nation in certain respects. After the decadence of Rome, when civilisation
gravitated towards the north, the valley of the Arno became one of the great
centres of the world’s activity. At that time the passage of the Alps was still
difficult, but communications by sea were established between Tuscany, France,
and Spain. The Apennines not only sheltered the fertile valleys opening upon
the Tyrrhenian against cold northerly winds, but also against the hordes of
barbarian invaders. Tuscany was, indeed, a favoured region,
and its intelligent <span class="xxpn" id="p250">{250}</span>
inhabitants made the most of the natural advantages they possessed. “Work”
was the great law of the Florentines, and all, without exception, were expected to
engage in it. Whilst Pisa disputed the dominion of the sea with Genoa and
Venice, Florence became the head-quarters of commerce, and its bankers extended
their operations to every part of Europe.</p>

<p>But Tuscany was more than a commercial and industrial country. What
Athens had been to the world two thousand years ago, republican Florence
became during its period of prosperity, and for the second time in the history of
mankind there arose one of those centres of light the reflected rays from which still
illuminate our own times. Arts, letters, sciences, and political economy—everything,
in fact, that is noble in this world was cultivated with an energy to
which nations had been strangers for a long time. The pliant genius of the
Tuscans revelled in every species of work, and amongst the names great in
history Florence may fairly claim some of the greatest. Where are the men that
have exercised a greater influence in the world of art and intellect than Giotto,
Orgagna, Masaccio, Michael Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Andrea del Sarto,
Brunelleschi, Savonarola, Galileo, or Macchiavelli? It was a Florentine, too,
Amerigo Vespucci, who gave his name to the New World, and justly so, for it
was Vespucci through whom the discoveries made by the Spaniards first became
known, and who, in 1501, bestowed the name of <i>Novus Mundus</i> upon the newly
discovered countries, whilst Columbus died in the belief that he had reached the
eastern coast of Asia.</p>

<p>The dialect of Florence has become the polished language of the whole of
Italy, and it is curious that this honour should not have been carried off by Rome.
But whilst Florence cultivated the arts and sciences, and through her great writers
exercised an immense influence, the city of the popes yielded herself up to the
worship of the past, and its literature was written in a dead language, more or less
successfully imitated from that of Cicero. The dialect of Rome never became a
language like that of Florence, but Italian is nevertheless indebted to Rome for
its musical pronunciation, that of the Tuscans being harsh and guttural. Hence
the old proverb, “Lingua Toscana in bocca Romana.” The delicate, pure poetry
breathed in the <i>ritornelli</i> which Tuscan peasants chant in the evening is highly
appreciated by all admirers of Italian, and the influence which the fine dialect of
the Florentines exercised upon the unification of Italy can hardly be overestimated.
The worshippers of Dante are almost justified in saying that Italian
unity dates from the day on which the great poet first expressed himself in the
firm and sonorous language which he had forged out of the various dialects spoken
throughout the peninsula.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The geographical position of Tuscany accounts for the influence it has exercised
upon Italy and the rest of the world, whilst its topography gives us the key
to the local history of the country. The Apennines and the mountains to the
south of the Arno divide it into a number of separate basins, each of which gave
birth to a small state or republic. At the time of the
Tyrrhenians Etruria formed <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
a confederation of cities, whilst during the Middle Ages it was divided into
numerous small republics, frequently at war with each other. Since that time
many changes have taken place in the relative importance of the various towns,
but even now most of the free cities of the Middle Ages, and even some founded
by the ancient Etruscans, occupy a high rank amongst the provincial towns of
Italy.</p>

<p>Florence (Firenze) is not one of these ancient cities of the Tyrrhenians; it is
merely a Roman colony of comparatively modern origin. In the time of the
Empire it was of small importance, for Fiesole, on a hill to the north, remained
the leading town of the country until destroyed by the Florentines, who carried
its columns and statues to their own town. The rapid growth of Florence during
the Middle Ages is due to its position on the highway which connects Germany,
Lombardy, and even Bologna with Southern Italy. As long as Rome was the
capital of Italy travellers starting from the valley of the Tiber crossed the Apennines
in the direction of Ancona and Ariminum. But after the fall of Rome,
when barbarian hordes inundated the country from the north, the high-roads
connecting the plains of Lombardy with the valley of the Arno rose into importance.
This great military highway became simultaneously a high-road of commerce,
and it was only natural that a great emporium should spring up on the
site occupied by Florence. The “city of flowers” prospered, and became the
marvel which we still admire. But the wealth of the growing commonwealth
proved its destruction. The rich bankers grasped at political power, the Medici
assumed the title of princes, and though the arts continued to flourish for
awhile, public virtues decayed, the citizens became subjects, and intellectual life
ceased.</p>

<p>Florence, as in the days of republican liberty, owes much of its wealth to the
industry of its inhabitants. There are manufactories of silks and woollen goods,
of straw hats, mosaics, china, cut stones (<i>pierra dura</i>), and other objects, all of
them requiring workmen possessed of taste and manual dexterity. But neither
these industries nor the commerce carried on by the town would have raised
Florence above the level of other populous Italian cities. The prominent position
it holds is due entirely to the beauty of its monuments, which attract to it the
lovers of art from every quarter of the world. Not even Venice is equally rich in
architectural masterpieces of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The museums
of Florence “la Bella”—such as the Uffizi, the Pitti Galleries, and the Academy
of Arts—are amongst the richest in Europe, and contain some of the most
highly prized treasures of art; its libraries abound in curious manuscripts and rare
old books. Nay, the very streets and piazzas of the town, with their palaces,
towers, churches, and statues, may be likened to a huge museum. Brunelleschi’s
Duomo; Giotto’s Campanilla, which was to “surpass in beauty all imagination can
conceive;” the Baptistery, with its incomparable doors of brass; the Piazza della
Signoria; the monastery of San Marco, now a museum; the gloomy palace of the
Strozzi; and numerous other buildings of superior merit make Florence the
delightful place it is. Its charms are enhanced by the beauty
of the surrounding <span class="xxpn" id="p252">{252}</span>
country, and the traveller will always recall with pleasure the walks along the
Arno, the hills of San Miniato and Belle Sguardo, and the picturesque spur upon
which lie the villas and ruins of Etruscan Fiesole. Unfortunately the climate of
Florence leaves much to be desired; the wind changes abruptly, and the heat in
summer is overpowering. <i>Il caldo di Firenze</i> has become proverbial throughout
Italy. Narrow streets, and to some extent the disregard of the laws of hygiene,
cause the mortality to exceed that of nearly every other town on the Continent.
During the Middle Ages pestilence was a frequent visitor, and Boccaccio tells us
that in an single season nearly 100,000 inhabitants, or two-thirds of the entire
population, were swept away by it. Targioni Tozetti contrasts the site of
Empoli, a small town to the west, with that of Florence, and regrets that a
project for removing Florence thither should not have been carried out, as proposed
in 1260.</p>

<p>The only town of any importance in the upper valley of the Arno is Arezzo,
an ancient city of the Etruscans, and at one time the capital of one of the most
prosperous republics of the Middle Ages. The inhabitants ascribe
to the “subtile <span class="xxpn" id="p253">{253}</span>
air they breathe the subtility of their spirits,” and indeed the list of famous men
connected with the town is very long. The present Arezzo, however, is a decayed
place, and lives upon the memories and the monuments of a past age. Cortona,
farther south, near the Lake of Trasimeno, claims to be the most ancient city of
Italy; but all traces of its former greatness have disappeared. Siena, which
formerly governed the whole of the hilly tract between the Arno and Ombrone,
has fallen from her high estate, not without the fault of its own citizens, who were
continually quarrelling amongst themselves. Siena no longer rivals Florence in
population, power, or industry, but may still compare with the city on the Arno
as regards its public buildings—many of them in the Gothic style—its works of
art, its quaint streets and piazzas, and its magnificent position on the slopes of
three hills. Chiusa, one of the most powerful towns of ancient Etruria, is of no
importance now, and only attracts antiquarians in search of its ancient tombs.
The vineyards of Montepulciano, on the same side of the vale of Chiani, produce
the “king of wines.” Volterra is only a small town now, interesting, however,
on account of its cyclopean walls and a museum abounding in Etruscan antiquities.
The environs are dreary in the extreme. Salt-works, yielding from 7,000 to 8,000
tons a year, quarries of alabaster, copper mines at Monte Catini, sulphur springs,
and the famous <i>lagoni di Monti Cerboli</i> (see p. <a
 href="#p242" title="go to p. 242">242</a>), are in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The cities at the foot of the Apennines, on the other side of the Arno, have
retained their importance, for they are favourably situated for commerce. Prato,
where the valley of the Arno is widest, is the centre of a rich agricultural district.
The quarries of serpentine in the neighbourhood have furnished building stones
for many of the most beautiful edifices of Tuscany, including the cathedral of
Prato, celebrated on account of Donatello’s marvellously sculptured pulpit.
Pistoja, where the railway descends from the Apennines, is a busy manufacturing
town. Other towns of some importance are Pescia, Capannori, in the “garden of
Italy,” and Lucca the industrious, with its celebrated pictures by Fra Bartolommeo.</p>

<p>The basin of the Serchio is of incomparable productiveness since its marsh lands
have been brought under cultivation. From the ramparts of Lucca one of the
most charming views may be enjoyed. On the one hand we have the towers and
cupolas of the town, on the other fertile fields and orchards, with white houses
peeping through the verdure, and distant hills surmounted by old towers. The
impression made by this view is one of perfect peace. In a country so fertile and
beautiful, it would seem, the people ought to be happy, and, if enthusiastic writers
can be believed, such is really the case, and the peasants of Lucca and of Lower
Tuscany in general enjoy advantages denied to their class elsewhere in Italy.
They are farmers for the most part, but hold their land by long leases, and their
share of its produce is regulated by ancient custom. The land, however, does not
suffice for their wants, and they emigrate in thousands in search of work. Many
of these emigrants work as grinders.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Upper Serchio valley, known as the Garfagnana, are as
industrious as those near Lucca, which is the natural outlet for its produce. The
slopes and spurs descending from the Apennines and Apuanic
Alps are cultivated <span class="xxpn" id="p254">{254}</span>
in terraces. Castelnuovo, the chief town of this valley, occupies one of the
most delightful spots of this picturesque district. The common people near it are
said to speak the best Italian, superior even to that of the Sienese.</p>

<p>The valley of the Magra is far more frequented than that of Garfagnana, for
the high-road from Parma to the Gulf of Spezia leads through it. In its upper
portion, in the heart of the Apennines, stands the small town of Pontremoli. Its
inferior portion, known as the Lunigiana, from the ancient city of Luni, is as
beautiful as the parallel valley of the Serchio. At Sazana it opens upon the
sea, and to the south of that charming town, where the Apuanic Alps approach
close to the sea, leaving only a narrow passage of some note in history, are situated
the towns of Carrara and Massa. Carrara, the “Quarry,” has replaced Luni as
the place from whence the white marbles so highly esteemed by sculptors are
exported, and choice blocks of which sometimes fetch £80 a cubic yard. No less
than 720 quarries perforate the neighbouring hills, and about 300 of these are
being worked now. The town may be likened to an agglomeration of sculptors’
studios, and its Academy has trained artists of high reputation. Massa enjoys
a better climate than Carrara, but its marbles are less highly esteemed. As to
the marbles of Serravezza, which are quarried in the Altissimo and other mountains
of the Apuanic Alps near the town of Pietra Santa, they are in many
instances as beautiful as those of Carrara. Michael Angelo highly appreciated
them, and had a road constructed to facilitate access to them. The quarries and
mines in the neighbourhood also yield slates, iron, lead, and silver.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn84" id="fnanch84">84</a></p>

<p>These towns at the foot of the Apuanic Alps were bound to prosper in proportion
as the country increased in wealth, whilst Pisa, the great commercial
republic of mediæval Tuscany, was doomed to decay, owing to the silting up of
its harbour. This Porto Pisano was situated about ten miles to the south of
what was then the mouth of the Arno. In 1442 its depth had been reduced to
five feet, a century later only rowing boats could enter it, and soon after it was
abandoned definitely. There are no traces of it now, and its very site is
disputed. But though Pisa is dead—Pisa <i>morta</i>—the city still possesses admirable
monuments of its past grandeur. It has a wonderful cathedral; an elegant
baptistery; its Campo Santa, with the famous frescoes of Orgagna and Gozzoli;
and a leaning tower commanding a view of the Pisan hills and the alluvial plains
of the Arno and Serchio. Its commerce has dwindled away, but it is still the
capital of a rich agricultural district, and its university is one of the best in
Italy. It possesses, moreover, that which no change in the commercial highways
can deprive it of, a mild climate, and during winter attracts numerous
visitors from the north.</p>

<p>Leghorn, or Livorno, has inherited the commerce of Pisa. It is the natural
outlet of the fertile districts of Tuscany, and its commerce is far more important
than might be supposed from the unfavourable configuration of the coast, and
is surpassed only by that of Genoa and Naples.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn85" id="fnanch85">85</a>
Thousands of Spanish and <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
Portuguese Jews who found a refuge here have contributed in no small measure
to the development of the resources of the town. From an architectural point of
view, Leghorn is one of the least interesting cities of Italy, but as the outcome of
human labour it is one of the most curious. Before the city could be built, the
swamps which occupied its site had to be drained, and an artificial harbour had
to be excavated for the protection of vessels. Numerous canals intersect the
north-western portion of the town, which is known as New Venice. A huge
breakwater marks the entrance to the harbour, and on a sand-bank in the offing
rises the tower of Meloria, which recalls the naval engagement in which the fleet
of the Pisans was destroyed by the Genoese.</p>

<p>Insular Tuscany consists of Elba and several smaller islands, which mark the
site of an isthmus that formerly joined the mainland to Corsica, and contribute
greatly towards the beauty of the Tuscan littoral.</p>

<p>Elba, once the miniature kingdom of Napoleon, is larger than all the other
islands together.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn86" id="fnanch86">86</a> An ancient dependency of the Etruscan city of Populonia,
Elba rises above the blue waters of the Tyrrhenian a picturesque group of
mountains. A narrow and dangerous strait separates its steep coasts from the
promontory of Piombino, where passing vessels were formerly obliged to pay toll.</p>

<p>The granitic heights of Monte Capanne, the eastern
extremity of the island, <span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
attain an elevation of 3,303 feet; the dome-shaped hills of serpentine at the other
extremity are 1,600 feet in height, and the centre of the island is occupied by
hills of various formations, covered with brushwood. The variety of rocks is very
great, taking into account the small extent of the island. Associated with the
granites and serpentine, we meet with beds of kaolin, and with marble similar
to that of Carrara. Remarkable crystals and precious stones abound to such
an extent, that Elba has been likened to a “mineralogical cabinet” on a
vast scale.</p>

<p>Formerly, when the sea was infested by pirates, the inhabitants retreated
to the recesses of the interior, or to the summits of steep promontories, where the
picturesque ruins of ancient fortifications may still be seen. Several of the old
inland villages continue to be inhabited; amongst others, that of Capoliberi, the
“Mountain of the Free,” which is looked upon as a sort of acropolis. After
the suppression of piracy the islanders came down to the <i>marina</i>, or coast,
and established themselves in the towns of Porto Ferrajo, Porto Longone,
Marciana, and Rio. The resources of the island are considerable, and afford
plenty of occupation to fishermen, salt-makers, wine-growers, and gardeners. The
inhabitants are hospitable, and, though neighbours of the fierce Corsicans, they
possess all the gentleness of Tuscans.</p>

<p>Elba is not, however, so much noted on account of its fisheries, vineyards, salt-works,
or commerce, as because of its rich deposits of iron ore. The russet-coloured
cliffs of ironstone are visible from the mainland. The huge excavations
made by the miners, many of whom are convicts, resemble the craters of extinct
volcanoes, and the reddish brown, violet, or blackish colour of the rocks helps
the illusion. Of the quantity of ore carried away from here in the course of
twenty-five or thirty centuries we can hardly form a conception. The ironstone
is bedded in layers, differing in colour according to the nature of the earthy
ingredients, and rising into hills 600 and more feet in height, the slopes of
which are covered with brushwood (<i>macchie</i>). Shovels and spades are the only
mining tools required in clearing away these heaps of ore, of which at least
100,000,000 tons remain. By regular mining operations 500,000 tons might
be obtained annually during twenty centuries. The annual produce at present
hardly exceeds 100,000 tons. The ore is more particularly suited to the manufacture
of steel. Loadstones abound near Capo Calamita. The mariners of
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean formerly made use of them in the construction of a primitive
ship’s compass, by placing them in a piece of cork, which they allowed to float
in a basin of water.</p>

<p>The smaller islands of the Tuscan archipelago are—Giglio, with quarries
of granite; Monte Cristo, a pyramidal rock rising 2,130 feet above the sea-level;
Pianosa, with an agricultural penal settlement; Capraja, with a small town
built within an amphitheatre of pink-coloured granite;
and Gorgona (987 feet).<a class="afnanch" href="#fn87" id="fnanch87">87</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">That portion of the Italian peninsula which has Rome for its centre may be
likened to the trunk of the body, for it is there the Apennines attain their greatest
height, and nowhere else to the south of the Po are rivers of equal magnitude met
with.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn88" id="fnanch88">88</a></p>

<p>The main rampart of the Apennines runs parallel to the coast of the Adriatic.
To the mariner, who sees these mountains rise above the verdure of the littoral
region, they have an appearance of the greatest regularity. Summit rises beyond
summit, one lateral chain succeeds to the other, and every one of the numerous
valleys descends perpendicularly to the coast. The slope throughout is steep, and
the geological strata, whether of Jurassic, cretaceous, or tertiary age, succeed each
other regularly from the snow-clad summits down to the promontories of the
coast. The only irregularity consists in a detached group of hills (1,880 feet) to
the south of Ancona, above which the axis of the Apennines changes its direction.
This region of Italy is the natural counterpart of Liguria. The position of
Ancona corresponds with that of Genoa, and the coast, which extends on the one
hand to Emilia, and on the other towards the peninsula of Monte Gargano, may
fairly be likened to the “Rivieras” of Genoa, with this exception, that its direction
is inverse. The territory between the mountains and the coast is narrow, the
littoral road frequently winds round promontories, and the towns extend up the
hill-sides. Still this portion of Italy is not as strongly protected by nature as
Liguria. Towards the north it expands upon the plain of the Po, whilst the
terraces at the foot of the main range of the Apennines afford easy access from
the west. During the whole of the Middle Ages and down to our own days
neighbouring states have fought for the possession of this territory, which has
become known, from this circumstance, as the “Marches;” that is, the disputed
frontier districts, where every town is a fortress perched on the top of a hill.</p>

<p>The Apennines forming the boundary between the Marches and Latium, or
Rome, like those of Etruria, are grouped in separate mountain masses. The first
of these commands the valley of the Tiber in the east; it extends in the north to
Monte Comero (3,828 feet) and the Fumajolo, or head-stream of the Tiber, and in
the south to Monte Verone (5,006 feet). Though inferior in height to other parts
of the Apennines, these mountains are known as the
<i>Alpe della Luna</i>. A gap, <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span>
through which passes the road from Perugia to Fano, separates them from Monte
Catria (5,585 feet). At that point the Apennines bifurcate, and two parallel
ranges can be traced thence for a distance of 120 miles, as far as the transverse
range of the Majella (9,158 feet), which reunites them, and from which radiate
the mountains of Southern Italy. These parallel chains belong to the Jurassic and
cretaceous formations, and neither of them forms a water-parting, for whilst the
Nera and other rivers tributary to the Tiber force themselves a passage through
the western one, that on the east is broken by numerous gorges, through which
rivers and torrents find their way into the Adriatic. The most considerable
of these rivers is the Pescara, which rises on the plateau of the Abruzzos, where it
is known as the Aterno, and traverses the eastern range where it is highest. The
gorge excavated by this river is sufficiently wide to afford space for a railway
joining the Adriatic to the basin of the Tiber.</p>

<p>The plateau of the Abruzzos, enclosed by these parallel ranges, may be looked
upon as the natural citadel of Central Italy. On its western side rise the double
pyramids of Monte Velino (8,157 feet); in the north Monte Vettore (8,131 feet)
forms the termination of the range of the Sibillini; in the east rises the culminating
point of the Apennines, a mountain covered with snow the greater part of the
year, and appropriately called the “Great Rock of Italy”—“Gran Sasso d’Italia”
(9,518 feet). The fact that this magnificent mountain is the highest in all Italy
has been known from times immemorial. The Romans conceived they had discovered
the “umbilic of Italy” in a small lake near it, upon which floated an island
formed of rank vegetation. The Marsi and their allies, when they took up arms
against their Roman oppressors, chose Corfinium, in its neighbourhood, for the seat
of their empire, and surnamed it Italica; and there, too, the first movements
which led to the resurrection of modern Italy took place. The Gran Sasso, as
seen from the Adriatic, affords a magnificent spectacle. Its calcareous masses
cannot boast of much beauty of profile, but this is compensated for by the fine
Alpine region extending beneath its summit, which remains the haunt of bears and
chamois, and where rare plants in the meadows remind us of Switzerland. Forests
of beeches and pines are still met with in a few places, and are all the more
appreciated as forests no longer exist in the lowland regions. This universal
destruction of the forests is one of the great misfortunes of Italy. In many parts
of the Roman Apennines even the soil has been washed away, and only in a few
crevasses do we meet with brooms and briers.</p>

<p>The valleys on the western slope of the Apennines are enclosed between
calcareous spurs of the main range, some of which attain a considerable elevation.
The Tiber itself thus passes between two lofty mountains, rising at the lower
extremity of two of these Sub-Apennine spurs, and forming a kind of triumphal
gateway. These are the Soracte (2,270 feet) and Gennaro (4,162 feet). These
fine mountains, with the Sabine Hills and the volcanic groups near them, form
the horizon of the Roman Campagna, and their natural beauties are enhanced by
the memories of art and history which attach to them.</p>

<p>Several ranges of hills and detached mountain groups of
calcareous formation, <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span>
like the Sub-Apennines, border upon the shore of the Tyrrhenian Sea and the
marshes which extend along it. Such are the hills, rich in alum, which are
grouped around the ancient trachytic cone of the Tolfa. Such, too, are the Monte
Lepini (4,845 feet), the naked crest of which has been likened to an ass’s back—<i>schiena
d’asino</i>—and which bound the Pontine Marshes on the east. In some
of the recesses of these hills there still exist forests of chestnut-trees and beeches,
where the descendants of the ancient Volsci may pasture their hogs; but almost
everywhere else the hill-sides are bare of vegetation, and the scorching rays of
the sun have split the rocks into innumerable angular fragments. To the east of
the marshes rises a summit with ten pinnacles, covered with dense shrub on the
land side, but barren towards the sea, a few stunted palms excepted, which grow
in the fissures of the rock. This isolated hill, a counterpart of the Argentaro of
Tuscany, is the Circello (1,729 feet), famous as the residence of the enchantress
Circe. The grotto where she changed human beings into animals is still pointed
out there to the curious, and the remains of cyclopean walls recall the mythical
age of the Odyssey. The ancient Greeks, who were but imperfectly acquainted
with Italy, looked upon this dreaded promontory of Circe as one of the most
important islands of the Western Cyclades.</p>

<p>During the glacial period the sea, in which have been deposited the chalk and
other rocks composing the Sub-Apennines, was the scene of volcanic action on a
grand scale. The matter ejected was heaped up in a line of volcanic cones,
running in a direction nearly parallel with the Apennines and the coast of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean. These cones are joined to each other by thick layers of tufa,
which cover the whole of the plain as far as the foot of the calcareous mountains,
and extend for a distance of nearly 120 miles, from Monte Amiata, in Tuscany, to
the mountains of Albano, being interrupted only by the alluvial valley of the
Tiber. Ponzi and other geologists are of opinion that this tufa was ejected from
submarine volcanoes, carried away by the currents, and equally distributed over
the depressions of the sea-bottom. No fossils have been discovered in it hitherto,
which is accounted for by the presence of icebergs, which prevented a development
of animal life.</p>

<p>This volcanic region is remarkable on account of its numerous lakes. The
largest of these, that of Bolsena, was formerly looked upon as an ancient crater.
This crater would have exceeded by far the largest volcanic vents met with in
the Andes or in Java, for it has a circumference of twenty-five miles, and covers
an area of forty-four square miles. Modern geologists, however, look upon this
crateriform lake as a basin of erosion, and though it occupies the centre of a
plateau formed of ashes, scoriæ, and lava, these do not form a steep edge towards
the lake, as in the case of veritable craters in the same district. One of the most
remarkable of these latter is that of Latera, to the west of the lake, in the centre
of which rises a cone of eruption, the Monte Spignano, which has a diameter
of nearly five miles.</p>

<p>The district of the Bolsena is likewise remarkable on account of its vertical
precipices of tufa and lava. Its picturesque towns and villages
are perched upon <span class="xxpn" id="p260">{260}</span>
bold promontories looking down on the valleys. The old town of Bagnorea
occupies the extremity of an immense mole, and is joined to the new town by a
giddy path, bounded by steep precipices, which timid travellers do not care to
venture upon. Orvieto stands on an isolated rock resembling a fortress. Pittigliano
is surrounded by precipices: by cutting away a few yards of the narrow isthmus
which joins it to the rest of the plateau, access to it would be impossible to all but
birds. In the Middle Ages, when nobles and towns were continually at war, the
capture of one of these eyries was looked upon as a grand achievement.</p>

<p>Lake Bolsena discharges its surplus waters through the Marta into the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean. The fine Lake of Bracciano, to the south of it, gives rise to
the Arrone. It, too, appears to be a basin formed by a subsidence of the ground
or erosion, and not a crater. The Lake of Vico, on the other hand, clearly
occupies an ancient volcano, though its rampart has been gutted towards the east.
Close to the lake, and within the encircling rampart, rises Monte Venere, a perfect
cone, the gentle slopes of which are luxuriantly wooded. Formerly the lake
surrounded this cone, but the breach through which its emissary escapes to the
Tiber having gradually been deepened, the waters of the lake subsided. Tradition
says that an ancient city lies at its bottom.</p>

<p>On crossing the Tiber we reach the beautiful volcanic group of Albano,
within the great crater of which may still be traced the remains of several
secondary craters, some of them occupied by lakes. The principal one of these,
Monte Cavo (2,790 feet), rises in the very centre of the exterior rampart.
Tradition points it out as one of Hannibal’s camps. The exterior slopes of the
mountain consist of pozzuolana, small stones, and ashes, through which the
torrents have dug out furrows in divergent directions. The
diversity of these <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span>
volcanic products enables us to trace the phases of activity of this Roman
Vesuvius, which was active at a much more recent epoch than the volcanoes
farther north, and sent its streams of lava to the very gates of Rome.</p>

<p>The Lake of Albano discharges its surplus waters through a tunnel 7,665 feet
in length, which has been in existence for more than twenty-two centuries. The
lake is famous on account of a small crab, large numbers of which are forwarded
to Rome during Lent. It is the only species of this animal hitherto discovered in
fresh water, and zoologists conclude from this that the crater now occupied by the
lake formerly communicated with the sea, but was separated from it by slow
upheavals and the ejection of volcanic products. Flint implements and vases of
baked clay, discovered in the thick layers of volcanic peperino, prove
that at the <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span>
period of the earliest eruptions the country was already inhabited by a civilised
population. Some of the vases referred to are doubly precious, for they present
us with delineations of the houses of that prehistoric epoch. Roman coins and
clasps of bronze, discovered in the upper layers of lava, prove that these are
comparatively recent. In fact, the most diverse developments of civilisation have
left their traces in these ancient craters. Alba Longa and other towns of the Latins
have been replaced by Roman cities; then came the castles of the popes, and of
other high dignitaries of the Church; and at present these hills are one of the
chief resorts of the crowds of strangers who flock to Rome from every quarter of
the world. On the culminating point of Monte Cavo stood the famous temple of
Jupiter Latialis, where the Latins celebrated their federal Feriæ. The last
remains of this temple were swept away in 1783, to be used in the construction
of a church. From its site the eye embraces a view extending to the hills of
Sardinia.</p>

<p>The Lake of Nemi no longer reflects in its bluish waters the foliage of
luxuriant trees, or the walls of that dreaded temple of Diana whose priest was
only allowed to assume office after he had killed his predecessor in a duel. It, too,
has its subterranean emissary, like the Lake of Albano. As to the Regillus,
famed for the defeat of the Latins by the Romans, it has dried up, whilst the
incrustating Lake of Tartari and that of the Solfatara, with its floating islands,
are more shallow ponds, which owe their fame almost exclusively to the vicinity
of Tivoli.</p>

<p>All these volcanic lakes are of considerable depths, whilst the lakes in the
calcareous regions are shallow.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn89" id="fnanch89">89</a> One amongst them, that of Fucino, has been
drained recently, and the same fate is in store for that of Trasimeno. Lake
Fucino originally occupied an area of 104 square miles, and its surplus waters
discharged themselves towards the north-west into the Salto, a tributary of the
Tiber. At an epoch not known to us the dimensions of the lake became less. It
no longer discharged an effluent, but its waters rose and fell according to whether
the seasons were wet or dry. Occasionally they rose as much as 50 feet, and two
cities, Marruvium and Pinna, are said to have been swallowed up during one of
these floods. At other times it was reduced to a swamp. The ancient Romans,
desirous of suppressing a hotbed of fever, and of gaining fertile soil for agriculture,
attempted to drain this lake. Claudius employed 30,000 slaves for eleven years
in cutting a passage through the mountains from it to the Liri. This great work
was carried on under the direction of the greedy Narcissus, but it turned out a
failure, for after a short time the tunnel became choked. In the thirteenth
century an attempt was made to reopen this tunnel, but the drainage of the lake
has only been achieved quite recently, in accordance with plans designed by
M. de Montricher, and carried out at the expense of
Prince Torlonia. Between <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
1855 and 1869 a new tunnel was excavated on the site of the ancient one, and
nearly 150,000,000 cubic yards of water were conveyed through it into the Liri,
and thence to the sea. The whole of the ancient lake bed has been converted into
smiling fields, traversed in all directions by carriage roads; houses have been
erected on spots formerly covered with water; fruit and ornamental trees have
been planted; and the salubrity of the country leaves nothing to be desired
now. Some idea of the progress made in the art of engineering since the time
of the Romans may be formed by comparing this new tunnel with the old one.
The latter was 18,500 feet in length, had an average section of 12 square yards,
and cost (according to M. Rotrou) £9,840,000. The new tunnel has a length of
20,680 feet, a section of 24 square yards, and cost £1,200,000.</p>

<p>The Lake of Perugia, better known as the Lake of Trasimeno, on account of
the terrible memories which attach to it, still retains nearly the dimensions which
it had at the dawn of history. If this lake were to rise only a few feet, its
surplus waters would find their way into the Tresa, a tributary of the Tiber; but
its basin is shallow, and evaporation suffices for carrying off the water conveyed
into it by its tributary rivulets. Amongst these is the famous Sanguinetto, on
the banks of which the armies of Hannibal and Flaminius were engaged in battle,
when,</p>

<p>The lake, with its islands and charming contours, is beautiful to look upon,
but the low hills surrounding it are sterile, the climate is insalubrious, its waters
harbour but few fish, and the inhabitants on its shores
look impatiently forward <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
to the time when the engineers will fulfil their promise of winning for agriculture
30,000 acres of fertile land now covered by the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>But far more urgent, on sanitary and economical grounds, are the claims of
the Roman Campagna; that is, of the region lying between the Tolfa of Cività
Vecchia, Monte Soracte, the Sabine Hills, and the volcanoes of Latium. Slavery
and mal­ad­mi­nis­tra­tion have converted a fertile region into a desert extending to
the very gates of Rome. Painters are enraptured with this Roman Campagna;
they admire its melancholy aspect, its picturesque ruins hidden beneath brambles,
its solitary pines, its pools reflecting the purple clouds, and visited by thirsty
buffaloes. True, this region, bounded by hills of bold contours, is full of grandeur
and sadness; but the air that hangs over it is deadly, the soil and climate of
this <i>Agro Romano</i> have deteriorated, and fever now reigns there supreme.</p>

<p>Two thousand years ago the Roman Campagna, which covers an area of
600,000 acres to the north of the Tiber, and extends from the sea to the mountains,
was a fertile and carefully cultivated country. Then its inhabitants were
reduced to the condition of serfs, the Roman patricians appropriated
the land, and <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
covered it with villas and parks. When these magnificent residences were given
up to pillage and to flames, the cultivators of the soil dispersed, and the country
immediately became a desert. Since that epoch most of the Agro is held in
mortmain by ecclesiastical corporations or princely families, and whilst all the
rest of Europe has been making progress, the Campagna has become even more
sterile and insalubrious. Swamps continually invade the lowlands, and an atmosphere
charged with miasmata hangs even above the hills. Malaria has already
knocked at the gates of Rome, and the fevers produced by it decimate the population
of its suburbs.</p>

<p>Not a village, not even a hamlet, is met with throughout this afflicted region.
The only buildings are the wretched storehouses of the proprietors, whose wide
domains are roamed over by herds of half-wild grey cattle, said to have been
introduced into Italy by the Huns, and distinguished by immense horns, frequently
suspended in the huts of the peasantry, who fancy that they keep off the
“evil eye.” The soil of these neglected pastures consists of alluvium mixed with
volcanic débris and marls, but only a few patches are cultivated. The farmers and
labourers who engage in this labour carry their lives in their hands, and are
frequently struck down by fever before they are able to regain
their villages in <span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
the hills. What can be done to restore to this region its fertility, salubrity, and
population? No doubt it will be necessary to drain the marshes, and to plant
trees capable, like the Eucalyptus, of absorbing the poisonous miasmata; and this
has been done, with a considerable amount of success, since 1870, near the abbey
of Tre Fontane. But, above all, it will be necessary to interest the cultivator
of the soil in its productiveness. Even in the most salubrious districts of the
ancient Papal dominions the population is being decimated by misery and the
maladies following in its train. In the valley of Sacco, to the south-east of Rome,
which abounds in cereals, vines, and fruit trees, the cultivator of the soil is
restricted to a diet of maize, for proprietors and money-lenders eat up the rest of
his produce.</p>

<p>An uncultivated and insalubrious region extends, likewise, along the sea to the
south of the Tiber. Poisonous vapours arise from the stagnant waters separated
by dunes from the sea, and in order to escape them it is necessary to seek a refuge
in the hills of the interior, or even on jetties built out into the sea, as at Porto
d’Anzio. The palaces which formerly lined the shore from Ostia to Nettuno, and
from the ruins of which have been recovered some of our most highly valued
art treasures, such as the Gladiator and Apollo Belvedere, have been buried
long ago beneath the dunes or in the swamps. The most dreaded of these
malarial districts lies at the foot of the Monti Lepini, and extends from Porto
d’Anzio to Terracina. It is known as the Pontine Marshes, from Pometia, a city
said to have perished before historical times. No less than twenty-three cities
formerly flourished in what is now a deserted and deadly country, but which was
the most prosperous of the districts held by the confederation of the Volsci. The
Roman conquerors created “peace and solitude” at the same time. Four
hundred and forty years after the building of Rome, when Appius constructed
his famous road to Terracina, the country was only a swamp. Various attempts
have been made since to reclaim this region, but it still remains the haunt of
boars, deer, and semi-savage buffaloes, whose ancestors were imported from Africa
in the seventh century. The canals dug during the reign of Augustus appear to
have been of little use; the works undertaken by Theodoric the Goth were more
efficacious; but stagnant waters and malaria in the end regained the mastery. The
engineers employed by Pius VI. towards the close of the eighteenth century
failed likewise, and this district of 290 square miles remains a wilderness to the
present day. If a brigand seeks refuge in it, pursuit is stopped, and he is allowed
to die in peace.</p>

<p>In order to drain these marshes an accumulation of difficulties will have to be
surmounted. A range of wooded dunes bounds the marshes on the west. Having
crossed these, we enter a second zone of marshes, which are separated from the sea
by a second range of dunes, extending northward from the Monte Circello, and likewise
densely wooded. These two formidable barriers would have to be surmounted
in order to drain the marshes towards the west. Nor are the prospects more promising
in the direction of Terracina, for there, too, every outlet is stopped by dunes.
The streams and canals crossing the marshes are, moreover, choked up
with a dense <span class="xxpn" id="p267">{267}</span>
growth of aquatic plants, which impedes the circulation of the water, feeble though
it be. Herds of buffaloes are sometimes driven into these streams to trample down
the vegetation, but neither this barbarous procedure nor the more regular process
of mowing has availed against its rapid and luxuriant growth, and the water
remains stagnant. Rains are not only heavy in this portion of Italy, but the
superabundant waters of neighbouring river basins actually find their way through
subterranean channels into the depression occupied by the Pontine Marshes.
This happens after heavy rains in the case of the Sacco, a tributary of the
Garigliano, and of the Teverone, a tributary of the Tiber, and
to this circumstance <span class="xxpn" id="p268">{268}</span>
must be ascribed the curious fact first ascertained by M. de Prony, viz. that the
volume of water annually discharged by the Badino, which drains the marshes,
exceeds by one-half the whole of the rain which annually descends upon them.
When this happens the whole of the country is under water. Another danger
arises during dry weather. It happens then occasionally that the parched
vegetation is ignited through the carelessness of herdsmen; the fire communicates
itself to the turfy soil, and the latter smoulders until the subsoil water is reached.
In this manner tracts of land which were looked upon as secure against every
inundation are converted into marsh. During the greater portion of the year
the Pontine Marshes present the appearance of a plain covered with herbage and
flowers, and it is matter for surprise that a country so fertile should be without
inhabitants. The town of Ninfa, which was built in the eleventh century, near
the northern extremity of the plain, has since been abandoned, its walls, houses,
and palaces still remaining, covered with ivy and other creeping plants.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that our engineers would be able to reclaim this desolate
region. The system adopted in the case of the valley of the Chiana may not
be practicable, but other, if more costly, means may be devised. Whatever the
outlay, it is sure to be productive, for even now the marshes yield rich harvests of
wheat and maize.</p>

<p>The Tiber, or Tevere, the great river of the Romans, has defied all attempts
at correction down to our own days, and its sudden floods are said to be even more
formidable now than they were in the days of the Republic. Ever since the time
of Ancus Martius there has been going on a struggle against the alluvium brought
down by the river, and it will need all the skill of the Italian engineers to master
this difficult problem.</p>

<p>The Tiber is by far the most important river of the peninsular portion of Italy,
and its basin is the most extensive.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn90" id="fnanch90">90</a> It is, too, the only river that is navigable
in its lower course, from Ostia to Fidenæ. The Tiber rises on the western slope
of the Alpe della Luna, in the latitude of Florence. The valley through which
it flows, whilst in the heart of the Apennines, is of surpassing beauty; at one time
it expands into broad and fertile basins, at others it is hemmed in by precipitous
rocks. Below the charming basin of Perugia the Tiber receives the Topino,
formed by the confluence of several streams in the old lacustrine basin of Foligno,
one of the most delightful districts of all Italy, situated at the foot of the Great
Apennines and of the Col Fiorito, which leads across them. The Clituno (Clitumnus)
debouches upon this plain, famous on account of its pellucid waters:―</p>

<p>The Nera is the most important tributary of the Tiber; “it gives it to drink,”
as the Italian proverb says, and rivals it in volume. It is formed by the junction
of several streams descending from the Sibylline Mountains, Monte Velino, and
the Sabine Hills. About two thousand years ago, it is said, most of these rivulets
did not reach the Tiber; they were intercepted in the plain of Rieti, where they
formed the Lacus Velinus, represented at the present day by a few ponds and
marshes scattered over the fertile fields of the “Garden of Roses.” A breach
effected in the calcareous rocks, and several times enlarged since, allowed the
pent-up waters of the Velino to escape to the Nera, and in doing so they formed
those beautiful cascades of Marmora, above Terni, whose charms have been
celebrated by poets and painters. The river falls down a
perpendicular height of <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span>
542 feet in a single sheet, and then rushes down, over heaped-up blocks of rock,
until it joins the more placid waters of the Nera. Far less
grand, but perhaps <span class="xxpn" id="p271">{271}</span>
more charming, are the numerous cascatellas of the Anio, or Teverone, the last
affluent of any importance which the Tiber receives above Rome. Standing on the
verdant hill upon which is built the picturesque town of Tivoli, silvery cascades
may be seen to escape in every direction. Some of them glide down the polished
rocks; others shoot forth from gloomy arches, remain suspended an instant in the
air, and then disappear again beneath the foliage; but every one of them, whether
a powerful jet or a mere thread of water, possesses some charm of its own, and,
as a whole, they form one of the most delightful spectacles to be witnessed in
Italy. It is these cascades which have rendered Tivoli famous throughout the
world; and in spite of the popular rhyme—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">modern
residences have taken the place of the villas of the ancient Romans,
amongst which that of Hadrian was the most sumptuous. Its ruins, to the west
of Tivoli, cover an area of three square miles. Recently it has
been proposed to <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
utilise the great water power of the Anio far more extensively than has
been done hitherto. The ancients contented themselves with quarrying the
concretionary limestone, or travertin, deposited by the calcareous waters of
the river, sometimes to the depth of a hundred feet. They made use of this
stone for the construction of their public buildings. Travertin, when first
quarried, is white; after a certain time it turns yellow, and subsequently assumes
a beautiful roseate hue, which imparts a character of majesty to the edifices
constructed of it.</p>

<p>Below their confluence with the Anio, the yellow waters of the Tiber,
discoloured by the clay brought down from the plains of Umbria, rush beneath
the bridges of Rome. Soon afterwards the river winds round the last hills,
which formerly bounded an ancient gulf of the sea, now silted up. The influence
of the tides makes itself felt. At the head of the Sacred Island, formerly
dedicated to Venus, and famous for its roses, but now a dreary swamp, covered
with reeds and asphodels, it bifurcates. The principal branch, the old Tiber,
passes to the south of this island. Ostia, which was the port of the river during
the early days of Rome, is buried now beneath fields of cereals and thistles, at
a distance of five miles from the sea. Excavations made there since 1855 have
laid bare several temples, tombs, and warehouses. The merchants of Rome were
compelled to abandon that city two thousand years ago, on account of a bar formed
at the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>The Roman emperors, anxious to have an outlet into the sea, ordered a ship
canal to be excavated to the north of Ostia. This is the Fiumicino, which the
erosive action of the Tiber has converted into a small river. Claudius had huge
docks excavated to the north of this canal, and a new Ostia arose near them.
Trajan opened another port to the south-east of it, which remained for several
centuries the port of Rome. But it, too, has been silted up for about a thousand
years, and the alluvium brought down by the Tiber is continually encroaching
upon the sea, the rate of progress being about three feet annually at the mouth
of the Fiumicino, and ten feet at that of the old Tiber. Extensive ruins of
palaces, baths, and storehouses exist near the ancient port of Trajan, and several
works of art have recently been excavated there.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Tiber is thus closed by a bar, like that of all other rivers which
flow into the Me­di­ter­ra­nean; and the Romans, instead of being able to make use
of their river for communicating with the sea, are obliged to have recourse to more
distant harbours. In former times they kept up this communication with Sicily,
Greece, and the Orient through Antium, Anxur (Terracina), and even Puteoli;
but since the countries of the North have risen into political and commercial
importance, Cività Vecchia has become the great maritime entrepôt of the valley
of the Tiber. It is well known that Garibaldi has conceived the stupendous
project of converting Rome into a great maritime city. The stagnant waters of
the Campagna are to be carried off by means of a huge sanitary canal, the bed of
the Tiber is to be deepened, and an artificial harbour capable of receiving the
largest vessels is to be constructed far out
in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span></p>

<p>The execution of this vast scheme is no doubt attended with immense difficulties,
not the least amongst which are the annual floods of the Tiber. Ancient
writers tell us that these inundations were dreaded not only because of the damage
done directly, but also because of the great quantities of animal and vegetable
deposits which remained in the fields after the subsidence of the waters. The nature
of these floods has continued the same down to the present time. At Rome, though
its distance from the sea is only twenty-two miles, the river frequently rises forty or
fifty feet, and in December, 1598, it rose sixty-five feet&#x202f;! How is this huge volume
of water to be disposed of after it has passed beneath the bridges of Rome? If
the destruction of the forests in the Apennines is one of the principal causes of
these floods, will it be sufficient to replant them? Or would it be preferable
to restore some of those ancient lakes into which numerous rivers discharged
themselves, which now take their course to the sea? The difficulties are great
indeed, for the western slope of the Apennines is exposed to the rain-bearing
westerly and south-westerly winds, and the floods of every one of the numerous
tributaries of the Tiber take place simultaneously, and combine to form one vast
inundation.</p>

<p>It is by no means difficult to account for the great floods of the Tiber which
take place in winter, but the condition of the river during summer has for a long
time baffled inquiry. The level of the river during the dry season is far higher
than could possibly be accounted for by the small quantity of rain which falls
within its basin. Its volume in summer is never less than half its average
volume, a phenomenon not hitherto observed in the case of any other river. The
Seine has a basin five times larger than that of the Tiber, and its average volume
is almost double; yet, after a continuance of dry weather, its volume is only a
third or fourth of the Italian river. This perennity of the Tiber can only be
accounted for by assuming that it is fed, during the dry season, from subterranean
reservoirs, in which the water is stored up during winter. These reservoirs must
be very numerous, if we are to judge by the numerous “sinks,” or “swallows,”
met with on the calcareous plateaux of the Apennines. One of these sinks,
known as the “Fountain of Italy,” near Alatri, close to the Neapolitan frontier,
has the appearance of a huge pit, 160 feet in depth and 300 feet across. Its
bottom is occupied by a forest, and numerous springs give rise to luxuriant
herbage, upon which sheep lowered by means of ropes feed with avidity. It is
from sinks like this that the rivers of the country, the Tiber and the Sacco, are
fed. It has been computed by Venturoli and Lombardini, the engineers, that
about three-fourths of the liquid mass of the Tiber during winter are derived from
subterranean lakes hidden in the depths of the Apennines. The volume of water
annually supplied from this source to the Tiber would fill a basin having an area
of 100 square miles to a depth of 80 feet&#x202f;!&#x202f;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn91" id="fnanch91">91</a></p>

<p>Primitive Rome is to a large extent indebted for her
power to the Tiber, not <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
because that river is navigable, but because it traverses the centre of a vast basin,
of which Rome is the natural capital. Rome, moreover, occupied a central
position with regard to the whole of Italy and the world of the ancients; but, as
has already been pointed out, Rome no longer lies upon any of the great high-roads
of nations. That city certainly occupies not only the centre of Italy,
but of all the countries surrounding the Tyrrhenian Sea; and its climate would
leave little to be desired, if it were not for the insalubrity of the Campagna. Still
Rome, though the residence of two sovereigns, the King of Italy and the Pope, is
not even the principal city of the peninsula, and still less the capital of the
Latin race. It is said that during the Middle Ages, when the popes resided
at Avignon, the population of Rome was reduced to 17,000 souls. Gregorovius,
than whom no one is better acquainted with that epoch in the history of Rome,
doubts this; but there can be no doubt that after the sack ordered by the Constable
of Bourbon its population was reduced to 30,000 souls. More recently
Rome has increased rapidly, but it is still very inferior to Naples, and even to
Milan.</p>

<p>From the very first the Romans were a mixed race. The myth of Romulus
and Remus, the rape of the Sabine women, and incessant internal conflicts bear
evidence to this fact. The remains of ancient cities, cyclopean walls, burial-grounds,
urns, vases, and ornaments prove that on the right bank of the Tiber
the Etrurians were at least as strong as the Italians. Elsewhere the Gauls
predominated, and from an intermixture of all these various peoples sprang the
primitive Roman.</p>

<p>When Rome had reached the zenith of her power things wore a different
aspect, and thousands of foreigners became amalgamated with the Latins, Gauls,
Iberians, Mauritanians, Greeks, Syrians, and Orientals of every race and climate;
slaves, freemen, and citizens flocked towards the capital of the world, and
modified the character of its inhabitants. Towards the close of the Empire there
were more strangers within the walls of Rome than Romans, and when the empire
of the West broke to pieces, and the empress-city was pillaged repeatedly by
barbarian hordes, the Italians had already become mixed with the most diverse
elements. This endless mixture between different races, victors and vanquished,
masters and slaves, accounts, perhaps, more satisfactorily for the great changes
which have taken place in the course of two thousand years in the character and
spirit of the Romans. Still the Romans on the right bank of the Tiber, the
so called Trasteverini, have preserved the old Roman type, as transmitted to us
in statues and on medals.</p>

<p>Rome is great because of its past, and its ruins are more attractive than its
modern buildings; it is a tomb rather than a living city. These monuments,
raised by the former masters of the world, strongly impress the imagination. The
sight of the Coliseum arouses an admiration akin to terror, unless we look upon
this formidable edifice as a mere heap of stones. The thought that this vast arena
was crowded with men who sought to kill each other, that the steps surrounding
it were occupied by 80,000 human beings who delighted in
this butchery and <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
encouraged it by their shouts, calls up an amount of baseness, ferocity, and
frenzy, whose existence could not fail to sap the foundations of Roman civilisation,
and make it an easy prey to the barbarian. The Forum awakens memories of
quite a different nature. Abominations were practised there, too, but its history
as a whole exhibits it as the true centre of the Roman world. It was from this
spot that the first impetus was given to the nations of the West; it was here that
the ideas imported from every quarter of the world bore fruit. The walls,
columns, temples, and churches which surround the Forum relate in mute language
the principal events in the history of Rome; and if we search beneath
existing edifices we meet with structures more ancient, which take us back to a
period still more remote, for edifice has succeeded edifice on this spot, where
pulsated the life of the Roman people. And thus it is throughout Rome. Every
ancient monument, arcade, or broken column, every stone, bears
witness to some <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span>
historical event, and though it may be difficult sometimes to interpret these
witnesses of the past, the truth is elicited by degrees.</p>

<p>In spite of pillage and wholesale destruction, there still exist numerous
ancient monuments, of which the Pantheon of Agrippa is one of the most
marvellous. The Vandals, who are usually charged with the work of destruction,
pillaged the city, it is true, but they demolished nothing. The systematical
destruction had begun long before their time, when the materials for building the
first church of St. Peter were taken from the Circus of Caligula, and from other
monuments near it. The same plan was pursued in the construction of innumerable
other churches and buildings of every kind. Statues were broken to pieces
and used for making lime, and in the beginning of the fifteenth century there only
remained six of them in all Rome, five of marble and one of bronze. The invasion
of the Normans in 1084, and the numerous wars of the Middle Ages, which were
frequently attended by pillage and conflagrations, wrought further havoc, but so
large had been the number of public buildings and monuments, that on the revival
of art in the sixteenth century many still remained for study and imitation. Since
that time the architectural collection enclosed by the walls of Rome has been
guarded with the utmost care, and still further enriched by the masterpieces of
Michael Angelo, Bramante, and others.</p>

<p>On the Palatine Hill the most curious remains of ancient Rome, including the
foundations of the palaces of the Cæsars and of the walls of <i>Roma Quadrata</i>, have
recently been laid open. It was on this hill, so rich in precious relics, that the
first Romans built their city, in order to afford it the protection of steep escarpments,
and of the marshes on the Tiber and Velabro. When Rome grew more
populous it became necessary to descend from this hill. The town spread over
the valley of the Velabro, which had been drained by Tarquin the Etruscan, and
then climbed up the surrounding hills. A small island in the Tiber occupied its
centre. This the Romans looked upon as a sacred spot. They enclosed it by a
masonry embankment, shaped like a ship, erected an obelisk in its centre to
represent a mast, and a temple of Æsculapius upon the poop. This island was
likened to a vessel bearing the fortunes of Rome.</p>

<p>There is still another Rome, the subterranean one, which is well worth study,
for we learn more from it about early Christianity than from all the books that
have been written. The crypts of the Christian burying-places occupy a zone
around the city a couple of miles in width, and embrace about fifty distinct
catacombs. Signor Rossi estimates the length of the subterranean passages at
360 miles. They are excavated in the tufa, and are, on an average, a yard in width,
but they include chambers which served as oratories, and numerous tiers of niches for
the bodies. The inscriptions, bas-reliefs, and paintings of these cities of the dead
were at all times respected by the pagans, and fortunately the entrances to them
were closed up at the time the Barbarians invaded Rome. This saved their
contents from destruction, and everything was found intact when they were first
reopened towards the close of the sixteenth century. These tombs prove that the
popular belief of the Christians of that time was very different from
what it is <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span>
represented to have been by contemporaneous writers, who belonged to a different
class of society from that of the majority of the faithful. A serene gaiety reigns
throughout, and lugubrious emblems find no place there. We neither meet with
representations of martyrdoms nor with skeletons or images of Death; even the cross,
which at a later epoch became the great symbol of Christianity, is not seen there.
The most common symbols met with are those of the Good Shepherd carrying a
lamb upon his shoulders, and the vine decked with leaves. In the oldest
catacombs, which date back to the second and third centuries, the figures are
Greek in character, and abound in heathen subjects. One represents the Good
Shepherd surrounded by the Three Graces. There are two Jewish catacombs,
likewise excavated in the tufa, and they enable us to compare the religious notions
which prevailed at that time amongst the followers of the two religions.</p>

<p>By an absurd predilection for mystical numbers, Rome is even now spoken of
as the “City of the Seven Hills,” although it lost all claim to
such a designation <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
after it had outgrown the walls built by Servius Tullius. Independently of Monte
Testaccio, which is merely a heap of potsherds, there are at least nine hills within
the walls of actual Rome, viz. the Aventino, to which the plebeians retired
during their feeble struggles for independence; the Palatino, the ancient seat of
the Cæsars; the Capitolino, surmounted by the temple of Jupiter; Monte Celio
(Cælius); the Esquilino; Viminale; Quirinale; Citorio; and the Pincio, with its
public gardens. Besides these, there are two hills on the opposite bank of the
Tiber, viz. Monte Gianicolo (Janiculum), the highest of all, and the Vatican,
which derives its name from the Latin word <i>vates</i>, a soothsayer, it having once been
the seat of Etruscan divination.</p>

<p>Faithful to its traditions, the last hill has ever since remained the place of
vaticinations. When the Christian priests left the obscurity of the catacombs they
established themselves upon it, and thence they governed Rome and the Western
world. The Papal palace, abounding in treasures of art, was built upon it, and close
to it stands the resplendent basilica of St. Peter, the centre of Catholic Christendom.
A long arcade connects the palace with the Castle of Sant’ Angelo, the
ancient mausoleum of Hadrian. The guns of this fortress no longer defend the
Vatican, for the temporal power of the pontiffs is a thing of the past; but their
sumptuous church of St. Peter, with its dome rising high into the air, and visible
even from the sea, its statues, marbles, and mosaics, bears witness to the fact that
the riches of all Christendom formerly found their way to Rome. St. Peter’s alone
cost nearly £20,000,000 sterling, and is only one out of the 365 churches
of the city of the popes. At the same time, the admiration which their
sumptuous edifice arouses is not without its alloy. A multiplicity of ornaments
dwarfs the proportions of this colossal building, and, more serious still, instead of
its being the embodiment of an entire epoch of its faith and ideas, it is representative
only of a transitory phase in the local history of Catholicism, of an age of
contradictions, when the paganism of the Renaissance and the Christianity of the
Middle Ages allied themselves in order to give birth to a pompous and sensuous
neo-Catholicism suited to the tastes and caprices of the century. How different is
the impression we derive from this building from that which the sombre nave of
a Gothic cathedral makes upon us&#x202f;! It is a remarkable fact that the quarter
of Rome in which the church of St. Peter is built is the only portion
of the city which was laid waste by the Mussulmans in 846, who are thus
able to boast of having sacked Papal Rome and taken possession of
Jerusalem, whilst the tomb of Mohammed has ever remained in the hands of the
faithful. As to the Jews, they did not come to Rome as conquerors. Shut up in
their filthy Ghetto near the swampy banks of the Tiber, and not far from that
arch of Titus which reminded them of the destruction of their temple, they have
been the objects of hatred and persecution during nineteen centuries. They have
survived, thanks to the power of their gold, and since their liberation from bondage
they contribute even more to the embellishment of the Italian capital than do
their Christian fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Our nineteenth century is not favourable to the creation of edifices
fit to rival <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
the Coliseum or St. Peter’s, but there are works of another nature, not less
deserving of attention, which may distinguish this third era in the history of
Rome. Above all, it will be necessary to protect the city against the floods
of the Tiber, and to improve its sanitary condition. The bed of the river will
have to be deepened, embankments constructed, and a system of drainage
established.</p>

<p>It is well known that the quantity of water supplied to the Rome of the
ancients was prodigious. In the time of Trajan nine grand aqueducts, having a
total length of 262 miles, supplied about 4,400 gallons of water per second, and
this quantity was augmented to the extent of one-fourth by canals subsequently
constructed. Even now, although most of these ancient aqueducts are in
ruins, the water supply of the capital of Italy is superior to that of most other
cities.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn92" id="fnanch92">92</a> But if the time should ever come when Rome will occupy the whole of
the space enclosed within its walls, if ever the Forum should again become the
centre of the city, then the want of water will be felt there as much as in most of
the other great towns of Europe.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the insalubrity of the environs, there is another reason why
modern Rome cannot compare with the ancient city. Its streets no longer
radiate from a centre towards all the points of the compass, as they did of
yore. The Appian Road, which on first leaving the city passes through a curious
avenue of tombs, is typical of the old roads, constructed in straight lines, and
shortening distances. It is true that these ancient highways have been superseded
by railways, but they are still few in number, and Rome is not situated
on a trunk line. Elsewhere railways were built from the capital of the country
towards its periphery; in Italy, on the contrary, it was Florence, Bologna, and
Naples which constructed lines converging upon Rome.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Rome is one of those large cities which are least able to exist upon their own
resources, and having no port, and its immediate vicinity being rendered uninhabitable
by miasmata, it has attached to it outlying places, and occupies a position
similar to that of a spider in the centre of its web. Its gardens, rural retreats,
and industrial establishments are all in the hill towns of Tivoli, Frascati (near
which on a ridge are the ruins of Tusculum), Marino (near which the confederated
nations of Latium held their meetings), Albano (joined by a magnificent viaduct
to Ariccia), Velletri (the old city of the Volsci), and Palestrina (more ancient than
either Alba Longa or Rome, and occupying the site of a famous temple of Fortune,
the pride of ancient Præneste). Its watering-places are Palo, Fiumicino, and
Porto d’Anzio, which adjoins the little town of Nettuno,
so famous because of the <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span>
haughty beauty of its women. Its only seaport is Cività Vecchia, a dreary town
on the Tyrrhenian Sea, with a magnificent harbour.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn93" id="fnanch93">93</a> The ancient harbours to the
south of the Tiber are very little resorted to in our day. Terracina, hidden amidst
verdure at the foot of white cliffs, is only used by Rome-bound travellers coming by
the coast road from the south.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn94" id="fnanch94">94</a> Nearly every other town of Latium is built on
one or other of the two great roads, of which one leads northward to Florence, whilst
the other penetrates the valley of the Sacco towards the south-east, and finally issues
upon the campagna of Naples. Viterbo, the “city of nice fountains and pretty
girls,” is the principal town in the north. Alatri, on the slope of the Garigliano,
and commanded by a superb necropolis enclosed by cyclopean walls, occupies a
similar position in the south. In the east, in one of the most charming valleys of
Sabina, traversed by the ever-cool waters of the Anio, lies Subiaco, the ancient
Sublaqueum, thus named after the three reservoirs constructed by Nero, who used
to fish trout in them with a golden net. It was in a holy cave (<i>sacro specu</i>) near
Subiaco that St. Benedict established his famous monastery, which preceded the
still more famous monastery of Monte Casino, and conjointly with that of Lérins,
in Provence, became the cradle of monachism in the West.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn95" id="fnanch95">95</a></p>

<p>Perugia, the capital of Umbria, on the road from Rome to Ancona, is one of the
ancient cities of the Etruscans, and excavations carried on in its vicinity have
revealed tombs of the highest interest. After every war and disaster this city
has arisen from its ruins, for its position in the midst of a fertile plain, and at the
point of junction of several natural high-roads, is most favourable. It is both a
Roman and a Tuscan city, and at the period of the Renaissance it gave birth to
one of the great schools of painting. There still remain numerous monuments at
Perugia which date back to that famous epoch, and although no longer one of the
artistic head-quarters of Italy, it is still the seat of a university; its trade, especially
in raw silk, is active; and its clean houses and streets, its pure atmosphere,
and charming inhabitants annually attract to it a large number of the foreigners
who spend the winter at Rome. Perugia has by far outstripped its rival, Foligno,
which was formerly the great commercial mart of Central Italy, and still carries
on a few branches of industry; amongst others, the tanning of leather. As to
Assisi, it is justly famous because of its temple of Minerva, and its gorgeous
monasteries decorated with the frescoes of Cimabue and his successor, Giotto,
the last of the Greek and the first of the Italian painters. Assisi is only a small
place now, but its environs are fertile and densely inhabited. It gave birth to
Francesco d’Assisi, the founder of the order of St. Francis.</p>

<p>Other towns of Umbria, though not now of much importance, may boast of
having once played a great part in history, or of possessing beautiful monuments.
Spoleto, the gates of which Hannibal sought in vain to force, has a superb basilica,
a Roman viaduct carried across a deep ravine, and mountains clad with pines and
chestnuts. Terni is proud of its famous cascade (see p. <a
 href="#p270" title="go to p. 270">270</a>). Orvieto, to the
north of the Tiber, near the frontier of Tuscany, is haughty and dirty, but justly
famous on account of its marvellous cathedral, one of the most costly and tasteful
buildings in the world. Città di Castello, on the Upper Tiber, and Gubbio, in the
very heart of the mountains, are the two principal towns in the Umbrian Apennines.
Both are delightfully situated, and possess efficacious mineral springs.
At Gubbio are shown the famous “Eugubian Tables,” seven plates of bronze
covered with Umbrian characters, and the only relics of that kind known to exist.
The little town of Fratta, now known as Umbertide, half-way between Perugia
and Città di Castello, is only of local importance.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn96" id="fnanch96">96</a></p>

<p>Ancona is the Adriatic port of the Roman countries. It is an ancient city of
the Dorians, which still retains the name given it by its founders, on account of its
being situated at the “angle” formed by the coast between the Gulf of Venice
and the Southern Adriatic. A fine triumphal arch near the mole attests the
importance which Trajan attached to the possession of this port. Thanks to its
favourable position and the labour bestowed upon the improvement of its harbour,
Ancona is one of the three great places of commerce on the Adriatic; it ranks next
to Venice, and is almost the equal of Brindisi, though not one of the stages on the
road to India. Its commerce is fed by Rome, the
Marches, and Lombardy; and <span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span>
amongst its exports are fruits, oil, asphalt from the Abruzzos, sulphur from the
Apennines, and silk, “the very best in the world,” if the native estimate of its quality
can be accepted.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn97" id="fnanch97">97</a> The other ports along this coast offer but little shelter, and
their commerce is small. Pesaro, the native town of Rossini, is only visited by
vessels of twenty or thirty tons. Fano merely admits barges. The small river port
of Sinigaglia (Senigallia) was formerly much frequented during the fair, at which
commodities valued at £1,000,000 sterling used to change hands, but since its
abolition in 1870 it has been deserted.</p>

<p>With the exception of Fabbriano, which occupies a smiling valley of the
Apennines, and of Ascoli-Piceno, on the river Tronto, the inland towns of the
Marches are built upon the summit of hills, but extend through their suburbs to
the cultivable plains. The principal amongst them are Urbino, whose greatest
glory consists in having been the birthplace of Raphael, and which, like its neighbour
Pesaro, formerly produced a kind of faience much valued by connoisseurs; Jesi;
Osimo; Maxerata; Recanati, the native place of Leopardi; and Fermo. One of the
most famous of these hill towns is Loreto, formerly the most-frequented place of
pilgrimage in the Christian world. Before the Reformation,
and at a time when <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
travelling was far more difficult than now, as many as 200,000 devotees visited
the shrines of Loreto every year. They were shown there the veritable house in
which the Virgin Mary was born, and which was carried by angels to the spot
it now occupies, where it is sheltered by a magnificently decorated dome. At
Castelfidardo, close by, was fought the battle which cost the Pope the greater part
of the “patrimony of St. Peter.”</p>

<p>There are only a few towns in the uplands of the Abruzzos. The principal of
these is Aquila, founded in the thirteenth century by the Emperor Frederick II.
The other towns are difficult of access, and, far from attracting inhabitants from
beyond, they send their vigorous sons to the lowlands, where they are known as
<i>Aquilani</i>, and highly appreciated as terrace gardeners. The most populous places
are met with in the lower valley of the Aterno, or command the road leading to
the coast and the fertile fields of the Adriatic slope. Solmona is embedded in a
huge garden, anciently a lake, and overlooked in the south by the steep scarps of
Monte Majella. Popoli, at the mouth of a defile, where the Aterno assumes the
name of Pescara, is one of the busiest places between the sea and the uplands.
Chieti, lower down on the same river, is said to have been the first town in the old
Neapolitan province to introduce steam into its spinning-mills and other factories.
Teramo and Lanciano are likewise places of some importance, but the only ports
along the coast, Ortona and Vasto, are merely frequented by small coasting vessels.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn98" id="fnanch98">98</a></p>

<p>A small district in the Marches, joined to the coast by a single road, has
maintained its independence through ages. Monte Titano, which rises in one of
the most beautiful parts of the Apennines, and the base of which has been used as
a quarry since time immemorial, bears upon its summit the old and famous city
of San Marino. From its turreted walls the citizens can see the sun rise above
the Illyrian Alps. San Marino, with some neighbouring hamlets, constitutes a
“most illustrious” republic, and is now the only independent municipality of
Italy. Named after a Dalmatian mason who lived as a hermit on Monte Titano,
San Marino has existed as a sovereign state from the fourth century, its citizens
having at all times known how to turn to advantage the jealousies of their neighbours.
The constitution of this republic, however, is anything but democratic.
The citizens, even though they be landed proprietors, have no votes, and are at
most permitted to remonstrate. The supreme power is vested in a Council of sixty
members, composed of nobles, citizens, and landowners. The title of councillor is
hereditary in the family, and when a family becomes extinct the remaining fifty-nine
choose another. The Council appoints the various officials, including a captain
for the town and one for the country. San Marino has its little army, its budget,
and its monopolies. A portion of its income is derived from the sale of titles and
of decorations, and on the payment of £1,400 it has even created dukes, who take
rank with the highest nobility of the kingdom. Taxation is voluntary. When
the public chest is empty a drummer is sent round
the town to invite <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
contributions. Though perfectly independent, this republic accepts a subsidy from Italy,
and claims the special protection of the King. Its criminals are shut up in an
Italian prison, its public documents are printed in Italy, and an Italian judge
occupies the bench of the republican prætorium. There is no printing-office in the
little state, for the Council is afraid that books objectionable to the surrounding
kingdom might be issued from it.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn99" id="fnanch99">99</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">Amongst
the various states which have been welded into the modern kingdom of
Italy, Naples, though second to others in population and industry, occupies the
largest area.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn100" id="fnanch100">100</a> It embraces the whole southern half of the peninsula, and its coast
has a development of 995 miles. Formerly the country was better known than
any other portion of Italy as Magna Græcia, but now many parts of it are
scarcely known at all.</p>

<p>The Apennines of Naples can hardly be described as a mountain chain. They
consist rather of distinct mountain groups joined by transverse ranges, or by
elevated saddles. In the first of these groups the serrated crest of the Meta
(7,364 feet) rises above the zone of trees, and is separated from the Abruzzos by
the deep valley of the Sangro, which flows to the Adriatic. Farther to the south,
beyond the valley of Isernia, which gives birth to the Volturno, rise the mountains of
the Matese, culminating in the Miletto (6,717 feet), the last bulwark of the Samnites.
Other summits, less elevated, but equally steep and imposing, rise near Benevento
and Avellino. They abound in savage defiles, in which many a bloody battle has
been fought. The valley of the “Furcæ Caudinæ,” where the Romans humbled
themselves before the Samnites, and made promises which they never meant to
keep, may still be recognised on the road from Naples to Benevento. The memory
of this event lives in the Caudarola Road, and the village of Forchia d’Arpaia. This
mountain region, which might fitly be called after its ancient inhabitants, is connected
in the south with a transversal chain, running east and west, and terminating
in Cape Campanello, to the south of the Bay of Naples. The beautiful
island of Capri, with its white cliffs and caverns flooded by the azure waters of
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, lies off this cape.</p>

<p>The eastern slope of the cretaceous mountains of Naples is gentle, and gradually
merges in argillaceous <i>tavolieri</i>, or table-lands, deposited during the Pliocene
epoch. The <i>tavoliere de la Puglia</i> is, perhaps, the most sterile and dreary
portion of Italy. It is cut up into terraces by deep ravines, through which
insignificant streams find their way to the Adriatic, and the centres of population
must be looked for at the mouths of valleys or along the high-roads. The country
itself is a vast solitude, deserted by all except nomad herdsmen. There are no
shrubs, and a kind of fennel, which forms the hedges separating the pasturing
grounds, is the largest plant to be seen. Hovels, resembling tombs or heaps of
stone, rise here and there in the midst of these plains. Fortunately the old feudal
customs which prevented the cultivation of these plains, and compelled the mountaineers
to keep open wide paths, or <i>tratturi</i>, through their fields for the passage
of sheep, have been abolished, and the aspect of the tavoliere improves from year
to year.</p>

<p>These tavolieri completely separate the mountains of the peninsula of Gargano—the
“spur” of the Italian “boot”—from the system of the Apennines. The
northern slopes of these rugged mountains are still clad
with forests of beeches <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
and pines, which supply the best pitch of Italy, and by thickets of carob-trees and
other plants, whose flowers are transformed by the bees into delicious honey; but
the very name of the most elevated summit—Monte Calvo (5,150 feet), or “bald
mountain”—proves that the deplorable destruction of forests has been going on
here as in the rest of the peninsula. In former times the recesses of Monte
Gargano were held by Saracen pirates, and they defied the Christians there for a
long time, in spite of the many sanctuaries which had been substituted for the
ancient heathen temples. The most famous of these was the church on Monte
Sant’ Angelo, at the back of Manfredonia, which was frequently resorted to by the
navigator about to leave the shelter of the bay for the dangerous coasts of Dalmatia
or the open sea.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan Apennines terminate in the south with the ancient volcano of
Monte Vultur (4,356 feet). Farther south the country gradually sinks down
into a table-land intersected by deep ravines, which discharge their waters in three
directions—towards the Bay of Salerno, the Bay of Taranto, and the Adriatic.
The Apennines, far from bifurcating, as shown on old maps, are cut in two by
the low saddle of Potenza, and on the peninsula forming the “heel” of Italy only
low ridges and terraces are met with.</p>

<p>The peninsula of Calabria, however, is rugged and mountainous. The Apennines,
near Lagonegro, again rise above the zone of forests. Monte Polino
(7,656 feet) is the highest summit in Naples. The group of which
it forms the <span class="xxpn" id="p288">{288}</span>
centre occupies the entire width of the peninsula, and along its western coast it
forms a wall of cliffs even less accessible than those of Liguria. Towards
the south it opens out into wooded valleys, where the inhabitants collect manna,
an esteemed medicinal drug. The deep valley of the Crati separates these
mountains from the Sila (5,863 feet), which is composed of granites and schists,
and still retains its ancient forests, haunted by brigands. The shepherds who
pasture their flocks in the clearings of these woods are said to be the descendants
of the Saracens, who formerly occupied this “Country of Rosin,” by which name
it was known to the Greeks.</p>

<p>To the south of the isolated Sila the peninsula narrows to a neck of small
elevation, where raised beaches attest the successive retreats of the sea. A
third mountain mass, of crystalline formation, rises to the south of this depression,
its furrowed slopes clad in forests. This is the Aspromonte (6,263 feet), or
“rugged mountain.” One of its spurs forms the palm-clad promontory of Spartivento,
or “parting of the winds.”</p>

<p>Naples, like Latium, has its volcanic mountains, which form two irregular ranges,
one on the continent, the other in the Tyrrhenian Sea, and are, perhaps, connected
beneath the sea with the volcanic mountains of the Liparic Islands and Mount
Etna. One of these is Mount Vesuvius, the most famous volcano of the world, not
because of its height or the terror of its eruptions, but because its history is that
of an entire population who have made its lavas their home.</p>

<p>Scarcely have we left the defile of Gaeta and entered upon the paradisiacal
Terra di Lavoro than we come upon the first volcano, the Rocca Monfina (3,300
feet), which rises between two calcareous mountains, one of which is the Massico,
whose wines have been sung by Horace. No eruption of this volcano is on
record, and a village now occupies its shattered crater. To judge from the
streams of lava which surround its trachytic cone, its eruptions must have
been formidable. The entire Campania is covered to an unascertained depth
with ashes ejected from it, and the marine shells found in them prove that the
whole of this region must have been upheaved at a comparatively recent
epoch.</p>

<p>The hills which rise to the south of the Campania cannot boast of the grandeur
of the Rocca Monfina, but they have been looked upon from the most remote
times as one of the great curiosities of our earth. Standing upon the commanding
height of the Camaldoli (518 feet), the Phlegræan Fields lie at our
feet. Acquainted as we now are with the far more formidable volcanoes of Java
and the Andes, this verdant sea-bound country may not strike us as a region of
horrors. But our Græco-Roman predecessors looked upon it with very different
eyes, and being unable to account for the phenomena they witnessed, they
ascribed them to the gods. The quaking soil, the flames bursting forth from
hidden furnaces, the gaping funnels communicating with unexplored caverns, lakes
which disappeared at irregular intervals, and others exhaling deadly gases—all
these things left their impress upon ancient mythology and poetry. At the time
of Strabo the shores of the Bay of Baiæ had become the
favourite resort of <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
voluptuaries, and sumptuous villas rose upon every promontory; but the terrors
inspired by hidden flames and mysterious caverns had not yet departed. A
dreaded oracle was said to have its seat there, guarded by Cimmerians, to whom
strangers desirous of consulting the gods had to apply. These troglodytæ were
doomed never to behold the sun, and only quitted their caverns during the night.
The Phlegræan Fields were likewise supposed to have been the battle-ground of
giants struggling for the possession of the fertile plains of the Campania. During
the Middle Ages Pozzuoli was looked upon as the spot from which Christ descended
into hell.</p>

<p>The number of craters still distinguishable is twenty. If we
were to suppose <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
the country to be deprived of its vegetation, its aspect would resemble that of the
surface of the moon. Even the city of Naples occupies an ancient crater, the
contours of which have become almost obliterated. To the west of it several old
craters can still be traced, one of them occupying a promontory of tufa, surmounted
by what is called the tomb of Virgil. Passing through the famous grotto of
Posilippo, we find ourselves in the Phlegræan Fields. On our left rises the small
conical island of Nisita, its ancient crater invaded by the sea. Farther on we
reach the crater known as the Solfatara, the Forum Vulcani of the ancients. Its
last eruption took place in 1198, but it still exhales sulphuretted hydrogen. The
Park of Astroni lies to the north. The interior slope of its enclosing wall is exceedingly
steep, so as to render impossible the escape of the deer and boars which
are kept within. The only access is through an artificial breach. Another crater,
less regular in shape, is now filled with the bubbling waters of the Lake of
Agnano. Near it is the famous Grotto of Dogs, with its spring of carbonic acid.
Other springs of gas and sulphurous water rise in the neighbourhood, and to
them Pozzuoli is indebted for its name, which is said to mean the “town of
stinks.” The town, in turn, has given its name to the earth known as pozzuolana,
which supplies an excellent material for the manufacture of cement.</p>

<p>The coast of the bay of Pozzuoli has undergone repeated changes of level, in
proof of which the three columns of the temple of Serapis are usually referred to.
At a time anterior to the Romans this temple, together with the beach upon which
it stands, sank beneath the waters of the sea, and its columns must have been exposed
to their action for many years, perhaps centuries, for up to a height of twenty
feet they are covered with tubes of serpulæ, and perforated by innumerable holes
bored by pholadidæ. In the course of time it rose again slowly above the waters.
This happened, perhaps, in 1538, when the Monte Nuovo sprang into existence. In
the short period of four days this new volcano, 490 feet in height, rose above the
surrounding plain, and buried the village of Tripergola beneath its ashes. A beach
now known as La Starza was formed at the foot of the cliffs, and two sheets of
water to the west of Monte Nuovo were cut off from the sea. One of these, the Lago
Lucrino, is famous for its oysters; the other is the Lago d’Averno, which Virgil, in
conformity with antique legends, described as the entrance to the infernal regions.
It occupies an ancient crater, and its pellucid waters abound in fish. There are no
exhalations of poisonous gases now, and birds fly over the lake with impunity. Still
its vicinity is haunted by the memories of the old pagan mythology. Lake Fusaro
is referred to by the ciceroni as the Acheron; close to it they point out the den of
Cerberus; the sluggish stream of Acqua Morta has been identified with the Cocytus;
Lake Lucrino, or rather a spring near it, with the Styx; and the remains of a subterranean
passage which connected the Averno with the sea are pointed out as the
whilom grotto of the Sibyl. The inhabitants of Cumæ, which was founded by a
colony from Chalcis, and the ruins of which still exist on the Me­di­ter­ra­nean coast,
to the east of Pozzuoli, brought with them the myths of Hellas, and Grecian poetry,
which took possession of them, has kept their memory alive.</p>

<p>It is quite proper that this region of Tartarus should have its
contrast in Elysian <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span>
Fields, and this name has actually been bestowed upon a portion of the peninsula
of Baiæ, which formed the chief attraction of the voluptuous Romans, and where
Marius, Pompey, Cæsar, Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, Agrippina, Nero, and
others had their palaces. Many a fearful tragedy has been enacted in these
sumptuous buildings. But hardly a trace of them exists now; nature has
resumed possession of the country, and the hills of tufa and volcanoes are the
only curiosities of the peninsula. Cape Miseno is one of these old volcanoes, and
from its summit may be enjoyed one of the most delightful prospects in the world.
The whole of the Bay of Naples—“a bit of heaven fallen upon our earth”—lies
spread out beneath us, and Ischia the joyous, formidable Capri, the promontory of
Sorrento, Mount Vesuvius, and the houses and villas of Naples fill up the space
bounded by the sea and the distant Apennines.</p>

<p>The island of Procida joins the Phlegræan Fields to the chain of island volcanoes
lying off the Bay of Gaeta. Ischia is the most important of these, and its volcano,
the Epomeo (2,520 feet), almost rivals Mount Vesuvius in height. One of its
most formidable eruptions occurred in 1302, at a time when Mount Vesuvius
was quiescent, but after the latter resumed its activity Ischia remained in
repose. Similarly, when the Monte Nuovo was ejected from the earth, the huge
volcano went to sleep for no less a period than one hundred and thirty years.
Ischia has known no eruption for five centuries and a half, and the gases escaping
from its thirty or forty hot springs are now the only signs of volcanic activity.</p>

<p>Ischia has certainly been upheaved during a comparatively recent epoch, for
its trachytic lavas rest in many places upon clays and marls containing marine
shells of living Me­di­ter­ra­nean species. Some of these have been found at a height
of nearly 2,000 feet. At the present time the tufa rocks of Ischia, and of the other
volcanic islands to the west of it, are being washed away by the sea. Ventotene,
the ancient Pandataria, to which the Roman princesses were exiled, is hardly
more now than a heap of scoriæ. Ponza, likewise a place of exile of the Romans,
has been separated by the erosive action of the sea into a number of smaller
islands. Its lavas overlie Jurassic rocks, similar in all respects to those of Monte
Circello on the coast nearest to it.</p>

<p>Mount Vesuvius (4,100 feet), the pride and dread of the Neapolitans, was likewise
an island during prehistoric times. The marine shells found in the tufa of
Monte Somma prove this, and on the east the volcano is still surrounded by plains
but little elevated above the sea. Formerly the mountain was covered with
verdure to its very summit, but the explosion of <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span>
79 shattered its cone, and
the ashes thrown up into the air shrouded the whole of the country in darkness.
Even at Rome the sun was hidden, and an age of darkness was believed to have
set in. When at length the light reappeared, the face of the country was found
to have undergone a marvellous change. The mountain had lost its shape, the
fertile fields were hidden by masses of débris, and entire towns had been buried
beneath ashes.</p>

<p>Since that terrible event Mount Vesuvius has vomited lavas and ashes on many
occasions. No periodicity has been traced in these outbursts,
and the intervals <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span>
of repose were generally of sufficient duration to enable vegetation to resume its
sway. But these eruptions have become more frequent since the seventeenth
century, and hardly a decade passes by without one or more of them. Each of them
modifies the contours of the mountain, whose great central vent has undergone
many changes. The crescent-shaped mass of débris which surrounds the old
crater, known as the Atrio del Cavallo, was undoubtedly of loftier height
previously to the great outburst of 79 than it is now. The vicinity of Naples has
facilitated a study of the phenomena attending volcanic eruptions, and an
observatory, permanently occupied, has been built close to the cone of eruption.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Mount Vesuvius, like that of all other volcanoes, abounds
in hot and gas springs, but there are no subsidiary craters. The nearest volcano
is Monte Vultur (4,356 feet), a regular cone on the eastern slope of the peninsula.
Its dimensions are larger than those of Vesuvius, but no eruptions are on record,
though a slight escape of carbonic acid is still going on from the two lakes which
occupy the bottom of its vast crater. On a line connecting Ischia, Vesuvius, and
Monte Vultur, and about half-way between the two latter, we meet with the most
abundant carbonic acid spring of Italy. The gas escapes with a hissing noise
from the pond of Ansanto, and the ground around the spring is covered with the
remains of insects, killed in myriads on coming within the influence of the
poisonous air. Near it the Romans erected a temple in honour of Juno the
Mephitic.</p>

<p>The disasters resulting from volcanic eruptions are great, no
doubt, but they <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span>
are exceeded by those caused by earthquakes. Some of these are unquestionably
caused by a subterranean displacement of lava, and thus, when Vesuvius
begins to stir, Torre del Greco and other towns at its foot incur the risk
of being buried beneath ashes or destroyed by earthquakes. But the Basilicata
and Calabria—that is to say, the two provinces lying between the volcanic
foci of Vesuvius and Etna—have many times been shaken by earthquakes
whose origin cannot be traced to volcanic agencies. Out of a thousand earthquakes
recorded in Southern Italy during the last three centuries, nearly all
occurred in the provinces named, and they were occasionally attended by the most
disastrous results. The earthquake of 1857 cost the lives of 10,000 persons at
Potenza and its vicinity, but the most disastrous of these events happened in 1785
in Southern Calabria. The first shock, which proceeded from a focus beneath the
town of Oppido, in the Aspromonte Mountains, only lasted a hundred seconds, but
within that short space of time 109 towns and villages were overthrown, and
32,000 of their inhabitants buried beneath their ruins. Crevasses opened in the
ground; rivers were swallowed up, to reappear again lower down as lakes; liquid
clay flowed down the hill-slopes like lava, converting fertile fields into unproductive
wastes. The commotion of the sea added to these horrors. Many of the inhabitants
of Scilla, afraid to remain on the quaking land, fled to their boats, when an
enormous mass of rock detached itself from a neighbouring mountain, and,
tumbling into the sea, produced a wave which upset the boats and cast their
fragments upon the shore. Want of food brought on famine, and typhus, as
usual, came in its train.</p>

<p>We are not yet able to predict earthquakes, and can only provide against them
by a suitable construction of our dwellings. There exists, however, another cause
of misery and depopulation which the Neapolitans might successfully combat,
as was done by their ancestors. In the time of the Greeks the swamps along
the coast were certainly less extensive than they are now. War, and a return
towards barbarism, have caused the rivers to be neglected, and to produce a
deterioration in the climate. Baia, a place once famous on account of its healthiness,
has become the home of malaria. Sybaris, the town of luxury and pleasure,
has been supplanted by a fever-plain “which eats more men than it is able to
nourish.” These paludial miasmata, poverty, and ignorance decimate the population
of La Puglia, Basilicata, and Calabria. Even certain Asiatic diseases, such
as elephantiasis and leprosy, ravage the country, which, from its rare fertility
and fine climate, ought to be in the enjoyment of the greatest prosperity.</p>

<p>Continental Sicily is indeed a favoured region, and its eastern slopes more
especially might be converted into one huge garden, for the rainfall there is
abundant. Naples enjoys a semi-tropical climate, and its winter temperature is
hardly inferior to the annual mean of London. Snow very rarely falls, and only
remains on the tops of the hills for a few weeks.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn101" id="fnanch101">101</a> The vegetation along the coast
is of tropical luxuriance. Oranges and lemons bear excellent fruit; date-palms
uplift their fan-shaped leaves, and sometimes bear fruit;
the American agave <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
stretches forth its candelabra-like branches; sugar-cane, cotton, and other industrial
plants, which elsewhere in Europe are scarcely ever met with outside hothouses,
grow in the fields. In the forests of Calabria the olive-tree affords as much shade
as does the beech with us. Even the bare rocks on the coast yield excellent
grapes and garden fruits. Naples, Sicily, Andalusia, and certain districts of
Greece and Asia Minor realise our beau idéal of the sub-tropical zone, and only
the heaths on the Adriatic slope and the upper valleys of the Apennines remind
us that we are still in Central Europe.</p>

<p>This delightful country is inhabited by a people having the most diverse
origin. It is now 2,300 years since the Samnites occupied the whole of it
from sea to sea. They were more numerous than the Romans, and might have
conquered the whole of Italy had there been more cohesion amongst them, and
some of that talent for organization which constituted the strength of their
adversaries. But they were split into five tribes, each speaking a different
dialect; and whilst the Samnites of the hills quarrelled with their kinsmen in the
plains, the latter were at enmity with the Hellenized Samnites who lived near
the Greek towns on the coast.</p>

<p>The whole of the coast of Southern Italy, from Cumæ—founded more than a
thousand years before our era—to Sipuntum, of which some ruins remain near the
modern Manfredonia, was dotted with Greek colonies. In these districts of
Southern Italy the bulk of the population is of very different origin from that
of other parts of the peninsula. To the north of Monte Gargano, Celtic,
Etruscan, and Latin elements preponderate, whilst Hellenes, Pelasgians, and
kindred races dominate in the south. Not only did civilised Greeks found their
colonies there, but the aboriginal population, the Iapygians, spoke a dialect akin
to the Hellenic, and Mommsen may be right when he conjectures that these
Iapygians were of the same origin as the modern Albanians.</p>

<p>At a subsequent date these southern Italians had to bow down before the
Romans, who founded military colonies amongst them, but never succeeded in
completely Latinising them. When the Roman Empire fell to pieces the Cæsars
of Byzantium still maintained themselves for a long time in Southern Italy, and the
Greek language again preponderated, but gradually Romance dialects gained the
upper hand. The inhabitants returned to a state of barbarism, but they retained
to a great extent their language and customs, and even now there are districts in
the south which are Italian in appearance rather than in reality, and in eight
villages of the Terra d’Otranto the Hellenic dialect of the Peloponnesus is still
spoken. Towns like Naples, Nicastro, Taranto, Gallipoli, Monopoli, and others,
whilst preserving their sonorous Greek names, have also retained many features
which recall the times of Magna Græcia.</p>

<p>Reggio—that is, the “city of the strait”—appears to have retained the use of
Greek much longer than any other town, and its patricians, who boasted of being
pure Ionians, still spoke the language of their ancestors towards the close of the
thirteenth century. In several remote towns of the interior Greek was formerly
in common use. The old popular songs of Bova, a small town
near the southern <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span>
extremity of Italy, are in an Ionian dialect more like the language of Xenophon
than is modern Greek. Down to a very recent date the peasants near Roccaforte del
Greco, Condofuri, and Cardeto spoke Greek, and when they appeared before a magistrate
they required an interpreter. At the present day all young people speak
Italian; the old language has been forgotten, but the Greek type remains. The
men and women of Cardeto are famous for their beauty, more especially the latter.
“They are Minervas,” we are told by a local historian. Their principal livelihood
consists in acting as wet nurses to the children of the citizens of Reggio. The
women of Bagnara, between Scilla and Palmi, are likewise of wondrous beauty,
but their features are stern, betraying Arab blood, and they are destitute of the
noble placidity of the Greek.</p>

<p>It is said that the women of the Hellenic villages of Calabria are still in the
habit of executing a sacred dance, which lasts for hours, and resembles the representations
we meet with on ancient vases, only they dance before the church
instead of the temple, and their ceremonies are blessed by Christian priests.
Funerals are accompanied by weeping women, who collect their tears in lachrymatories.
Elsewhere, as in the environs of Tarento, the children consecrate the
hair of their head to the manes of their ancestors. Old morals, no less than old
customs, have been preserved. Woman is still looked upon as an inferior being,
and even at Reggio the wives of citizens or noblemen who respect ancient
tradition confine themselves to the gynæceum. They do not visit the theatre, go
out but rarely, and when they walk abroad are attended by barefooted servants,
and not by their husbands.</p>

<p>In addition to Samnites, Iapygians, and Greeks, who form the bulk of the
population of Southern Italy, we meet with Etruscans in the Campania; Saracens
in the peninsula of Gargano, in the Campania, the marina of Reggio, Bagnara,
and other coast towns; Lombards in Benevento, who retained their language down
to the eleventh century; Normans, from whom the shepherds on the hills are
supposed to be descended; and Spaniards in several coast towns, especially at
Barletta, in Apulia. The Albanians have probably furnished the largest contingent
of all the strangers now domiciled in Southern Italy. They are numerous on the
whole of the eastern slope of the peninsula, from the promontory of Gargano to
the southernmost point of Calabria. One of their clans came to Italy in 1440,
but the bulk of them only arrived during the second half of the fifteenth century,
after the heroic resistance made by Scanderbeg had been overcome by the Turks.
The conquered Skipetars were then compelled to expatriate themselves in order to
escape the yoke of the Turks, and they were received with open arms by the Kings
of Naples, who granted them several deserted villages, which are now amongst
the most flourishing of Southern Italy. The descendants of these Skipetars, who
are principally domiciled in the Basilicata and Calabria, rank among the most
useful citizens of the country. They take the lead in the intellectual regeneration
of the old kingdom of Naples, and were the first to join the liberating army
of Garibaldi. Many have become Italianised, but there are still over 80,000 who
have neither forgotten their origin
nor their language. <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span></p>

<p>The Neapolitans are undoubtedly one of the finest races of Europe. The
Calabrians, the mountaineers of Molise, and the peasants of the Basilicata are so
well proportioned, erect, supple of limb, and agile, that their low stature, as compared
with the races of the North, can hardly be a subject of reproach; and the
nobility and expression of the faces of Neapolitan women fully compensate for
the irregularity we frequently meet with. The faces of the children, with their
large black eyes and well-formed lips, beam with intelligence, but the wretched
existence to which too many of them are condemned soon degrades their physiognomy.
Supremely ignorant, the Neapolitan is, nevertheless, most admirably gifted
by nature. The country which has produced so many great men since the days
of Pythagoras is in nowise inferior to any other; its philosophers, historians, and
lawyers have exercised a powerful influence upon the march of human thought;
and the number of great musicians which it has produced is proportionately large.</p>

<p>Still, in many respects, the inhabitants of Southern Italy hold the lowest
rank amongst the nations of Europe. Ever since the annihilation of the Greek
republican cities the country has been subjected to foreign masters, who have either
devastated it or systematically oppressed its inhabitants. With the exception of
Amalfi, no other town was granted the privilege of governing itself for any
length of time. The very position of the country exposed it to dangers. Placed
in the centre of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, it was on the high-road of every pirate or
invader, whether Saracen or Norman, Spaniard or Frenchman, and the absence
of any natural cohesion between its various districts prevented its population from
organizing a united resistance against the attacks of foreign invaders. Southern
Italy has not the river basins of Lombardy, Tuscany, Umbria, or Rome; there
exists no centre of gravity, so to say, and the country is split up into separate
sections having nothing in common.</p>

<p>The government under which the Neapolitans lived until quite recently was
most humiliating. “I do not require my people to think,” said King Ferdinand
II. of Naples. Ideas which did not commend themselves to the authorities
were punished as crimes, and only mendicity and moral depravity were allowed
to flourish. Science was compelled to live in retirement; history to seek a refuge
in the catacombs of archæology; and literature was corrupt or frivolous. Of the
Neapolitans who did not expatriate themselves only a very small number became
eminent. Schools were hardly known outside the large towns, and where they did
exist they were placed under the supervision of the police. Men able to read and
write were looked at askance, and, to escape being accused of belonging to some secret
society, they were compelled to turn hypocrites. Old superstitions exist in full force,
and the heathen hallucinations of Greeks and Iapygians still survive. The idolatrous
Neapolitan casts himself down before the statue of St. Januarius, but heaps
imprecations upon the head of his saint if his miraculous blood does not quickly
liquefy. Similar superstitions exist in nearly every town of Naples. Every one
of them has its patron saint or deity, who, if he should fail to protect his people,
is treated as a common enemy. As recently as 1858 the villagers of Calabria,
irritated by a drought, put their venerated saints into
prison; and Barletta, <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
about the same period, had the melancholy honour of being the last town in
Europe in which Protestants were burned alive. Such is the fanaticism still met
with in the second half of the nineteenth
century&#x202f;!&#x202f;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn102" id="fnanch102">102</a></p>

<p>One of the great superstitions of the Neapolitans refers to the “evil eye.”
The unfortunate being who happens to have a nose like a battle-axe and large
round eyes is looked upon as <i>jettatore</i>, and is avoided as a fatal being. If by
any evil chance his glance happens to fall upon any unfortunate person, it is considered
necessary to counteract it by the influence of an amulet resembling the
<i>fascinum</i> of the ancients, or by some other means no less potent. Coral amulets
are looked upon as most efficient, and many who pretend not to believe in
their virtues are the first to make use of them. The peasants of Calabria wear
an image of their patron saint upon the chest, and shield their cattle and houses by
means of the images of saints or household gods. At Reggio a cactus may be
seen near the door or on the balcony of every house, which has been placed
there to keep off evil influences, and is universally known as <i>l’albero del mal’ occhio</i>
(the tree of the evil eye).</p>

<p>Next to superstition, the great scourge of Southern Italy is brigandage. The
very name of Calabria conjures up in our imagination picturesque brigands armed
with carbines. Unfortunately this Calabrian brigand is no myth, invented to serve
the purposes of the stage. He really exists, and neither the severity of the laws
put in motion against him nor political changes have brought about his extermination.
On many occasions, after a successful hunt for brigands had been
carried on, the authorities felicitated themselves upon having rid the country of
this scourge, but it regularly revived.</p>

<p>In Sardinia and Corsica the peasant takes up arms from a desire for vengeance,
but in Calabria from poverty. Feudalism, though abolished in name, still
flourishes in that country. Nearly the whole of the soil belongs to a few great landowners,
and the peasant, or <i>cafore</i>, is condemned to a life of ill-remunerated toil.
In years of plenty, when the rye, chestnuts, and wine suffice for the wants of his
family, he works without grumbling, but in years of dearth brigandage flourishes.
The brigand, or <i>gualano</i>, looks upon the feudal lord as the common enemy, steals his
cattle, sets fire to his house, and even takes him prisoner, releasing him only on
payment of a heavy ransom. Some of these bandits become veritable wild beasts,
thirsting after blood; but, as long as they confine themselves to avenging wrongs,
they may count upon the complicity of all other peasants. The herdsmen of the
mountains supply them with milk and food, furnish them with information, and
mislead the carabiniers sent in pursuit of them. All the poor are leagued in
their favour, and refuse to bear witness against them. Moreover, most of these
Neapolitan bandits, conscientious in their own way, are extremely pious. They
swear by the Virgin or some patron saint, to whom they promise a portion of their
booty, and religiously place the share promised upon the altar. Not content with
wearing amulets all over the body to turn aside bullets, they are said sometimes
to place a consecrated wafer in an incision they make in their hand, in the belief
that this will render deadly their own bullets.</p>

<p>The fearful poverty of the South Italian peasantry has led to another practice,
even worse than brigandage. Foreign speculators, Christians as well as Jews, travel
the country, and particularly the Basilicata, in order to
purchase children, whom <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span>
their poverty-stricken parents are ready to part with for a trifle. The more intelligent
and prettier the child, the greater the likelihood of its passing into the
hands of these dealers in human flesh. The latter are threatened with the
penalties of the law, but custom and ignoble accomplices enable them to evade
them, and to carry their living merchandise to France, England, Germany, and
even America, where the children are converted into acrobats, street musicians,
or simple mendicants. The chances of this shameful commerce have been carefully
calculated, and the losses arising from deaths and the cost of travelling are more
than covered by the earnings of the children. Viggiano, a small town of the
Basilicata, is more especially haunted by these traffickers, for its inhabitants
possess a natural gift for music.</p>

<p>Voluntary emigration is on the increase, and if it were not for the obstructions
placed in the way of young men liable to the conscription, certain districts would
become rapidly depopulated in favour of South America. Only the poorest peasants
remain behind. This emigration influences in a large measure the customs of the
country, and, conjointly with railways and factories, will no doubt bring about an
assimilation of Southern Italy to the rest of the peninsula. Brigandage and the
traffic in children will doubtless disappear, but the proletarianism of manufacturing
towns is likely to be substituted for them.</p>

<p>For the present Naples is almost exclusively an agricultural country. The
tavolieri of Puglia, and the hills which command them, remain for the most part
a pastoral country, but the greater portion of the productive area of Naples is
under cultivation. As in the time of the Romans, cereals, with oil and wine,
form the principal produce; but, in addition to these, tobacco, cotton, madder, and
several other plants used in manufactures, are grown. With some care these products
might attain a rare degree of excellence. Even now the oil of the Puglia
competes successfully with that of Nice, and the wines grown on the scoriæ of Mount
Vesuvius enjoy their ancient celebrity, the Falernian of Horace, grown in the
Phlegræan Fields, disputing the pre-eminence with the Lachrymæ Christi of
Vesuvius and the white wine of Capri.</p>

<p>The agricultural products of Naples are almost exclusively derived from the coast
region, and commerce is principally carried on in coasting vessels. The interior is
sterile to a great extent, and there are no metalliferous veins to attract population.</p>

<p>Southern Italy has no natural centre, and, as its life has at all times been
eccentric and maritime, it is but natural that all the large towns should have
sprung up on the coast. Two thousand years ago, when Greece was a civilised
country and Western Europe sunk in barbarism, the most important towns lay
on the Ionian Sea facing the east. But, when Rome became the mistress of the
world, Magna Græcia was forced to face about, and Naples became the successor
of Sybaris and Tarentum. This position of vantage it has retained even to the
present day, when Western Europe has become the focus of civilisation. The
wave of history has passed over Tarentum and Sybaris, and whilst the fine port
of the former is now deserted, the latter, at one time the largest city of all Italy,
has entirely disappeared. <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span></p>

<p>Naples, the “new town” of the Cumæans, has for centuries been the most
populous town of Italy, and even now the number of its inhabitants is double
that of Rome. In the days of Strabo Naples was a large town. Greeks who
had made money by teaching or otherwise, and who desired to end their days in
peaceful repose, used to retire to that beautiful town, where Greek manners predominated,
and the climate resembled that of their native country. Many Romans
followed their example, and Naples, together with the numerous smaller towns
dotting the shores of its magnificent bay, thus became a place of repose and
pleasure. At the present day it attracts men of leisure from every part of the
world, who revel in its beauties and enjoy the noisy gaiety of its inhabitants—“masters
in the art of shouting,” as Alfieri called them. The prospect from the
heights of Capodimonte and the other hills surrounding the immense city is full
of beauty: promontories jut out into the blue waters, islands of the most varied
colours are scattered over the bay, shining towns stretch along the foot of verdant
hills, and vessels ride upon the waves. Looking inland, we behold the
grey summit of Vesuvius, which, lurid at night, and always threatening, imparts a
modicum of danger to the voluptuous picture.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans are indeed a happy people, if such a term may be applied to any
fraction of mankind. They know how to enjoy the gifts of nature, and are content,
if need be, with very little. Naturally intelligent, they are equal to any enterprise;
but, as they hate work, they soon give up what they have begun, and make
short of their want of success. Travellers were formerly fond of describing that
curious type, the <i>lazzarone</i>, the idle man of pleasure, who, enveloped in a rag, slept
on the beach or in the porch of a church, and disdained to work after he had
earned the pittance sufficing for his simple wants. There still remain a few representatives
of this type, but the material exigencies of our time have absorbed the
majority of these idle tatterdemalions, and converted them into labourers. Others
have succumbed to disease, for they knew nothing of sanitary laws, and dwelt in
damp cellars, or <i>bassi</i>, beneath the palaces of the wealthy. Naples contributes her
fair share towards the industrial products of the peninsula. The principal articles
manufactured are macaroni and other farinaceous pastes, cloth, silks known as
<i>gros de Naples</i>, glass, china, musical instruments, artificial flowers, ornaments,
and everything entering into the daily consumption of a large city. Its workers
in coral are famous for their skill; and Sorrento, near Naples, supplies the much-prized
workboxes, jewel cases, and other articles carved in palm-wood. The ship-yards
of Castellamare di Stabia are more busy than any others in Italy, those of
Genoa and Spezia alone excepted. The sailors of the bay are equal to the Ligurians
in seamanship, and surpass them as fishermen. The inhabitants of Torre del Greco,
who engage in coral-fishing, are well acquainted with the submarine topography
of the coasts of Sardinia, Sicily, and Barbary, and the least movement of the air
or water reveals phenomena to them which remain hidden to all other eyes. They
own about 400 fishing-boats, which depart in a body, and their return after a successful
season presents a spectacle which even Italy but rarely affords.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn103" id="fnanch103">103</a></p>

<p>Naples, with its magnificent bay, and the fertile tracts of the Campania and
the Terra di Lavoro near it, could hardly fail to become a great commercial city,
and if it holds an inferior rank in that respect to Genoa, this is owing to its not
being placed upon a great high-road of international commerce. The country
depending upon it is of comparatively small extent; only a single line of rails
crosses the Apennines; and travellers who follow the mountain road to Taranto are
not, even now, quite safe from brigands. The foreign commerce of the city is
carried on principally with England and France, and the coasting trade is
comparatively of great importance.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn104" id="fnanch104">104</a></p>

<p>The university is one of the glories of Naples. Founded
in the first half of <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
the thirteenth century, it is one of the oldest of Italy, but has had its periods of
disgraceful decay. Up to a recent period, when archæology and numismatics were
the only sciences not suspected of revolutionary tendencies, it was a place of intellectual
corruption, but its regeneration has been brought about with marvellous
rapidity. The young Neapolitans now study science with a zest sharpened by
abstinence; and, if the rather gushing eloquence of the South could be trusted,
Naples has become the greatest seat of learning in the world. Thus much is
certain, that the 2,000 students of the university will give a great impulse to the
“march of ideas.”</p>

<p>Naples possesses an admirable museum of antiquities, open to all the world, and,
more precious still, the ruins of Pozzuoli, Baiæ, and Cumæ, and catacombs no less
interesting than are those of Rome; and, above everything else, the Roman city of
Pompeii, which has been excavated from the ashes of Mount Vesuvius, beneath
which it lay buried for seventeen centuries. It is not merely a City of the Dead,
with its streets and tombs, temples, markets, and amphitheatres, which these
excavations have restored to us, but they have likewise given us an insight into
the life of a provincial Roman city. When we gaze upon inscriptions on walls
and waxed tablets, at work interrupted, at mummified corpses in the attitude
of flight, we almost feel as if we had been present at the catastrophe which
overwhelmed the town. No other buried city ever presented us with so striking a
contrast between the tumult of life and the stillness of death. In spite of a hundred
years of excavation, only one-half of the city has yet been revealed to us. Herculaneum
is buried beneath a layer of lava sixty feet in thickness, upon which the
houses of Resina, Portici, and other suburbs of Naples have been built, and but
very few of its mysteries have been revealed to us. Of Stabiæ, which lies hidden
beneath the town of Castellamare, close to the beach, we know hardly anything.</p>

<div class="dcaptionsml">CAPRI, SEEN FROM MASSA LUBRENSE.</div>
</div><!--dctr-->

<p>Numerous populous towns cluster around Naples, rivalling it in beauty. To
the south, on the shores of the bay, are Portici, Resina, Torre del Greco, Torre
dell’ Annunziata, Castellamare, and sweet Sorrento, with its delicious climate, its
delightful villas and olive groves. Off Cape Campanella, facing the volcanic
islands of Ischia and Procida, at the other extremity of the bay, rise the bold cliffs
of Capri, full of the memories of hideous Tiberius, the <i>Timberio</i> of the natives.
Another bay opens to the south of that barren mass of limestone, its entrance
guarded by the islets of the Sirens, who sought in vain to cast their spell over
sage Ulysses. This bay is hardly inferior in beauty to that of Naples; its shores
are equally fertile, but neither of the three cities, Pæstum, Amalfi, and Salerno,
which successively gave a name to it, has retained its importance for any length of
time. Amalfi, the powerful commercial republic of the Middle Ages, whose code
was accepted by all maritime nations, is almost deserted now, and only shelters a
few fishing-smacks within its rocky creek. In a delightful valley near it stands
the old Moorish city of Ravello, almost as rich as Palermo in architectural
monuments. Salerno is much more favourably situated than Amalfi, for the road
of the Campania debouches upon it. The town is said to have been founded by a
son of Noah, and when the Normans occupied the country
in the eleventh century <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span>
they made it their capital. But its ancient splendours have gone. Its university,
at one time the representative of Arab science, and the most famous in Europe for
its medical faculty, has made no sign for ages, and Salerno has now no claim
whatever to the title of “Hippocratic town.” It aspires, however, to rise into
importance through commerce and industry, and a breakwater and piers might
convert it into a formidable rival of Naples. The inhabitants are fond of repeating
a local proverb―</p>

<div class="dpoem fsz6"><div class="nowrap">
<p class="pv0"><span class="spqut">“</span>When
 Salerno a port doth obtain</p>
<p class="pv0"><span class="spqutspc">T</span>hat
 of Naples will be inane.”</p>
</div></div><!--dpoem-->

<p>Pæstum, or Posidonia, the ancient mistress of the bay, stood to the south-east
of Salerno. It was founded by the Sybarites on the ruins of a more ancient town
of the Tyrrhenians. The Roman poets sang this “city of roses” on account of
its cool springs, shady walks, and mild climate. It was destroyed by the Saracens
in 915, and its ruins, though amongst the most interesting of all Italy, dating
as they do from a period anterior to that of Rome, were known only to shepherds
and brigands up to the middle of last century. Its three temples, the most
important of which was dedicated to Neptune, or Poseidon, are amongst the most
imposing of continental Italy, their effect being heightened by the solitude which
surrounds them and the waves which wash their foundations. The traveller,
however, cannot afford to remain for any length of time within their vicinity, for
the site of the ruins is surrounded by marshes, the exhalations from which sadly
interfere with the excavations going on.</p>

<p>Numerous towns and villages are dotted over the champaign country separating
Mount Vesuvius from the foot-hills of the Apennines. Starting from Vietri, a
suburb of Salerno on the banks of a narrow ravine, we ascend to Cara, a favourite
summer retreat, abounding in shade-trees. Near it is a monastery famous
amongst antiquaries on account of its ancient parchments and diplomas. On
descending to the plain of the Sarno we pass Nocera, a country residence of the
ancient Romans; Pagani, still situated within the region of woods; Angri, which
manufactures yarns from cotton grown in its environs; and Scafati, more industrious
still. Near it may be seen the ruins of Pompeii, the town of Torre dell’
Annunziata, and, on the southern slope of Vesuvius, the houses of Bosco Tre Case
and Bosco Reale. There are savants who believe they can trace in the veins of
the inhabitants of Nocera and the neighbourhood the Arab and Berber blood of
the 20,000 Saracens who were settled here by the Emperor Frederick II.</p>

<p>The valley of the Sarno, above Nocera, is densely peopled as far as the foot of
the Apennines, and another chain of villages extends northwards to the town of
Avellino, the fields of which are enclosed by hedges of filbert-trees (<i>avellana</i> in
Italian), and which is important on account of its intermediary position between
the mountains and the plain. The population, however, is densest in that portion
of the Campania known as the “Happy” (Felice), which extends between
Vesuvius and Monte Vergine. Sarno, named after the river, though far away
from it, abounds in cereals, vines, fruit, and vegetables, and manufactures cotton
stuffs and raw silk. Palma stands in the midst of fertile
fields; Ottajano, the <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
town of Octavius, on the lower slope of the Somma of Vesuvius, is famous for its
wines; Nola, where Augustus died, and which gave birth to Giordano Bruno, has
fertile fields, but is better known through the fine Greek vases found in its ruins,
and on account of the remains of an amphitheatre built of marble, and of greater
size than that of Capua.</p>

<p>Famous Capua, the ancient metropolis of the Campania, at one time the rival
of Rome, with half a million inhabitants dwelling within its walls, has been completely
stripped of its former splendours. Its name is applied now to a sullen
fortress on the Volturno, the <i>Casilinum</i> of the Romans; and Santa Maria, which is
the representative of the veritable Capua, offers no “delights” other than those of a
large village. In its environs, however, may still be seen the ruins of a fine amphitheatre,
a triumphal arch, and other remains of a vast city. Caserta, the “town of
pleasure” of the modern Campania, lies farther to the south. It boasts of a large
palace, shady parks, and vast gardens ornamented with statues and fountains, and
was the Versailles of the Neapolitan Bourbons. An aqueduct supplies it with
water from a distance of twenty-five miles, and crosses the valley near Maddaloni
by means of a magnificent bridge, built about the middle of last century by Vanvitelli,
and one of the masterpieces of modern architecture.</p>

<p>The great Roman highway bifurcates to the north of Capua and the Volturno.
One branch turns towards the coast; the other, along which a railway has been
built, skirts the volcano of Rocca Monfina, follows the valley of the Garigliano
and of its tributary the Sacco as far as the eastern foot of the volcano of Latium,
and then descends into the Campagna of Rome. Historically the coast road is the
more famous of the two. It first passes close to Sessa, the ancient city of the
Aurunci, whose acropolis stood in the crater of the Rocca Monfina. It then turns
towards the coast, and having crossed the Garigliano near its mouth, where it
is bounded by insalubrious marshes, it penetrates the defile of Mola di Gaeta,
officially called Formia, in memory of ancient Formiæ, where Cicero lived and
died. Travellers coming from Rome first look down from this spot upon the
beauties of the Campania, and see stretched out before them the Bay of Gaeta, with
the volcanic islands of Ponza, Ventotene, and Ischia in the distance. Gaeta, a
fortress which guards this gateway to the Neapolitan paradise, is built on the
summit of Monte Orlando, occupying a small peninsula attached to the mainland
by an isthmus only 300 yards in width. The port of Gaeta is well sheltered
against westerly and northerly winds, and is much frequented by coasting vessels
and fishing-smacks; but Gaeta itself is better known as a fortress. It was here
the kingdom of the Two Sicilies was put an end to by the surrender of Francis II.
in 1861.</p>

<p>Towns of some importance are likewise met with on following the eastern road
from Naples to Rome. The most considerable amongst them is San Germano, the
name of which has recently been changed into Casino, in honour of the famous
monastery of that name occupying a terrace to the west of the town, and affording a
glorious prospect of hills and valleys. This monastery was founded in the sixth
century by St. Benedict, or Bennet, and its rules
have been accepted throughout <span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span>
the Eastern Church. No body of men has ever exercised a greater influence upon
the history of Catholicism than these Benedictine monks of Monte Casino. At the
height of its power the order held vast estates throughout Italy, and many popes
and thousands of Church dignitaries have been furnished from its ranks. The
library of Monte Casino is one of the most valuable in Europe, and the services
formerly rendered to science by the Benedictines have saved this monastery from
disestablishment, a favour likewise extended to the monastery of La Cava and the
Certosa of Pavia.</p>

<p>There are but few towns of importance in the mountain region of Naples.
Arpino, the ancient Arpinum, the birthplace of Cicero and Marius, with cyclopean
walls built by Saturn, is the most populous place in the upper valley of the Liri,
to the south of the mountains of Mantese. Benevento occupies a central position
on the Calore, the principal tributary of the Volturno, and several roads diverge
from it. The ancient name of this place was <i>Maleventum</i>, but in spite of its change
of name the town has frequently suffered from sieges and earthquakes, and of all
the great edifices of its past there now remains only a fine triumphal arch erected
in honour of Trajan. The city walls, nearly four miles in circumference, have for
the most part been constructed from the fragments of ancient monuments.</p>

<p>Ariano, to the east of Benevento, and also in the basin of the Volturno, is
built upon three hills commanding a magnificent prospect,
extending from the <span class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span>
often snow-clad Matese Mountains to the cone of the Vultur. It lies on the railroad
connecting Naples with Foggia and the Adriatic, and carries on a considerable
trade. Campobasso, the capital of Molise, is likewise an important commercial
intermediary, though still without a railway.</p>

<p>The commercial towns on the Adriatic slope of the Apennines are of greater
importance than those to the east. Foggia, on the Tavoglieri di Puglia, upon
which converge four railways and several high-roads, is a great mart for provisions,
and in importance and wealth, though not in population, is the second city of
Naples. Several smaller towns surround it like satellites, such as San Severo,
Cerignola, and Lucera, which became wealthy in the thirteenth century, when the
Saracens, exiled from Sicily by Frederick II., settled here. Foggia, however, and
its sister cities, in spite of the proximity of the Bay of Manfredonia, have no direct
outlet to the sea, for the coast for a distance of thirty miles, from Manfredonia to
the mouth of the Otranto, is fringed by insalubrious lagoons and marshes. The
reclamation of these is absolutely necessary to enable Southern Italy to develop
its great natural resources. The largest of these lagoons or marshes, that of
Salpi, has been reduced to the extent of one-half by the alluvium conveyed into it
by the rivers Carapella and Ofanto, but as long as the new land remains uncultivated
deadly miasmata will not cease. At the eastern extremity of this marsh
stood the ancient city of Salapia.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the peninsula of Gargano, to the north of these marshes,
are the harbours of Manfredonia and Vieste, very favourably situated for sailing
vessels compelled by stress of weather to put into port. The first harbour to the
south of the marshes is Barletta, near which is the “Field of Blood,” recalling the
battle of Cannæ. Barletta exports cereals, wines, oil, and fruit, partly grown on
the old feudal estates near the inland towns of Andria, Corata, and Ruyo. The
latter, the ancient <i>Rubi</i>, has yielded a rich harvest of antiquities of every kind.
The other coast towns to the south-east of Barletta are—Trani, which carried on
a considerable Levant trade towards the close of the Middle Ages; Bisceglia;
Molfetta; Bari, the most populous town on the Adriatic slope of Naples; and
Monopoli, all of which are much frequented by coasting vessels. Tasano, near
Monopoli, occupies the site of the ancient port of Gnatia, and, like Rubi, has
well repaid the search for archæological remains.</p>

<p>Brindisi, at the northern extremity of the peninsula of Otranto, in the time
of the Romans and during the Crusades, was one of the great stations on the
route from Western Europe to the East, and is likely again to occupy that
position. It lies at the very entrance to the Adriatic. Its roadstead is excellent,
and its harbour one of the best on the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. The entrance is narrow,
and was formerly choked up with the remains of wrecks and mud, but is now
practicable for steamers of the largest size. The two arms of the harbour bear
some resemblance to the antlers of a stag, and to this circumstance the town is
indebted for its name, which is of Messapian origin, and means “antler-shaped.”
Brindisi has recently become the European terminus of the overland route to
India, and many new buildings have risen in honour of this
event, which it <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
was expected would convert the town into an emporium of Eastern trade. These
expectations have not been realised. Several thousand hurried travellers pass
that way every year, but Marseilles, Genoa, and Trieste have lost none of their
importance as commercial ports in consequence. Moreover, when the Turkish
railways are completed, the position now held by Brindisi will most likely be
transferred to Saloniki or Constantinople.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn105" id="fnanch105">105</a></p>

<p>Taranto, on the gulf of the same name, is making an effort, like its neighbour
Brindisi, to revive its ancient commercial activity. Its harbour, the <i>Piccolo Mare</i>,
or “little sea,” is deep and perfectly sheltered, and its roadstead, or <i>Mare Grande</i>,
is fairly protected by two outlying islands against the surge. As at Spezia, springs
of fresh water, known as Citro and Citrello, rise from the bottom of the harbour
as well as in the roadstead. The geographical position of Taranto enables it successfully
to compete with Bari and the other ports of the Adriatic for the commerce
of inland towns like Matera, Gravina, and Altamura, and it appears to be
destined to become the great emporium for the Ionian trade. No other town of
Italy offers equal facilities for the construction of a port, but the two channels, one
natural and the other artificial, which join the two “seas” have become choked,
and only small craft are now able to reach the harbour. Modern Taranto is a small
town, with narrow streets, built to the east of the Greek
city of Tarentum, on the <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span>
limestone rock bounded by the two channels. Its commerce has been slowly
increasing since the opening of the railway, its industry being limited to fishing,
oyster-dredging, and the manufacture of bay-salt; and the Tarantese enjoy the
reputation of being the most indolent people in Italy. The heaps of shells on the
beach no longer supply the purple for which the town was formerly famous; but
the inhabitants still make use of the byssus of a bivalve in the manufacture of
very strong gloves.</p>

<p>The only towns of any importance in the peninsula
stretching southwards from Brindisi and Taranto are Lecco
and Gallipoli, the former surrounded by cotton plantations,
the latter—the Kallipolis, or “beautiful city,” of the
Greeks—picturesquely perched on an islet attached by a
bridge to the mainland. The surrounding country, owing to
the want of moisture, is comparatively barren.</p>

<p>The western peninsula of Naples is far better irrigated than that of Otranto,
but this advantage is counterbalanced to a large extent by the mountainous
nature of the country, and by its frequent earthquakes. Potenza, a town at the
very neck of this peninsula, half-way between the Gulf of Taranto and the Bay
of Salerno, most happily situated as a place of commerce, has repeatedly been
destroyed by earthquakes, and its inhabitants have only ventured to rebuild it in
a temporary manner.</p>

<p>The famous old cities of Calabria, such as Metapontum and Heraclea, have
ceased to exist. Sybaris the powerful, with walls six miles in circumference, and
suburbs extending for eight miles along the Crati, is now covered with alluvium
and shrubs—“its very ruins have perished.” The city of the Locri, to the south
of Gerace, which existed until the tenth century, when it was destroyed by the
Saracens, has at least retained ruins of its walls, temples,
and other buildings. <span class="xxpn" id="p309">{309}</span>
The only one of these old cities still in existence is Cotrone, the ancient Crotona,
the “gateway to the granary of Calabria.” In travelling along the coasts
of Greater Greece we feel astonished at the few ruins of a past which exercised so
powerful an influence upon the history of mankind.</p>

<p>The existing towns of Calabria cannot compare in importance with those of a
past age. Rossano, near the site of Sybaris, is the small capital of a district, and is
visited only by coasters. Cosenza, in the beautiful valley of the Crati, at the foot
of the wooded Sila, keeps up its communications with Naples and Messina through
the harbour of Paola. Catanzaro exports its oil, silk, and fruit either by way of
the Bay of Squillace, on the shores of which Hannibal once pitched his camp,
or through Pizzo, a small port at the southern extremity of the Bay of Santa
Eufemia. Reggio, nestling in groves of lemon and orange trees at the foot of the
Aspromonte, is the most important town of Calabria. It stands on the narrow
strait separating the mainland from the island of Sicily, and could not fail to
absorb some of the commerce passing through that central gateway of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.
Messina and Reggio mutually complement each other, and the
prosperity of the one must result in that of the sister city.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn106" id="fnanch106">106</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">The Trinacria of the ancients, the island with the “three promontories,” is
clearly a dependency of the Italian peninsula, from which it is separated by a
narrow arm of the sea. The Strait of Messina, where narrowest, is not quite two
miles in width. It can be easily crossed in barges, and, with the resources at our
command, a bridge might easily be thrown across it, similar enterprises having
succeeded elsewhere. It can hardly be doubted that before the close of this
century either a tunnel or a bridge will join Sicily to the mainland, and human
industry will thus restore in some way the isthmus which formerly joined the
Cape of Faro to the Italian Aspromonte. We know nothing about the period when
this rupture took place, but to judge from the ancient name of the strait—Heptastadion—it
must have been much narrower in former times.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn107" id="fnanch107">107</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span></p>

<p>From an historical point of view Sicily may still be looked upon as a portion
of the mainland, for the strait can be crossed almost as easily as a wide river. On
the other hand, it enjoys all the advantages of a maritime position. Situate in the
very centre of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, between the Tyrrhenian and the eastern basin,
it commands all the commercial high-roads which lead from the Atlantic to the
East. Its excellent harbours invite navigators to stay on its coasts;
its soil is <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
exceedingly fertile; the most varied natural resources insure the existence of its
inhabitants; and a genial climate promotes the development of life. Hardly a
district of Europe appears to be in a more favourable position for supporting a
dense population in comfort. Sicily, indeed, is more densely populated and
wealthier than the neighbouring island of Sardinia or either of the Neapolitan
provinces, the Campania alone excepted, and rivals in importance the provinces
of Northern Italy.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn108" id="fnanch108">108</a></p>

<p>Sicily, whenever it has been allowed to rejoice in the possession of peace and
freedom, has always recovered with wonderful rapidity; and it would certainly
now be one of the most prosperous countries if wars had not so frequently devastated
it, and the yoke of foreign oppressors had not weighed so heavily upon it.</p>

<p>The triangular island of Sicily would possess great regularity of structure
if it were not for the bold mass of Mount Etna, which rises above the shores of the
Ionian Sea at the entrance of the Strait of Messina. From its base to the summit
of its crater, that huge protuberance forms a region apart, differing from the rest
of Sicily not only geologically, but also with respect to its products, cultivation,
and inhabitants.</p>

<p>Ancient mariners mostly looked upon the Sicilian volcano as the highest
mountain in the world; nor did they err much as respects the world known to
them, for only at the two extremities of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, in Spain and Syria, do
we meet with mountains exceeding this one in height; and Mount Etna is not only
remarkable from its isolated position, but likewise by the beauty of its contours, the
lurid sheen of its incandescent lavas, and the column of smoke rising from its
summit. From whatever side we approach Sicily, its snowy head is seen rising
high above all the surrounding mountains. Its position in the very centre of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean contributed in no small measure to secure to it a pre-eminence
amongst mountains. It was looked upon as the “pillar of the heavens,” and at a
later epoch the Arabs only spoke of it as <i>el Jebel</i>, “<i>the</i> mountain,” which has
been corrupted by the people dwelling near it into “Mongibello.”</p>

<p>The mean slopes of Mount Etna, prolonged as they are by streams of lava
extending in every direction, are very gentle, and on looking at a profile of this
mountain it will hardly be believed that its aspect is so majestic. It occupies,
in fact, an area of no less than 460 square miles, and its base has a development
of about 80 miles. The whole of this space is bounded by the sea, and by
the valleys of the Alcantara and Simeto. A saddle, only 2,820 feet in height,
connects it in the north-west with the mountain system of the remainder of Italy.
Small cones of eruption are met with beyond the mass of the
volcano to the north <span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
of the Alcantara, and streams of lava having filled up the ancient valley of the
Simeto, that river was forced to excavate itself another bed through rocks of
basalt, and now descends to the sea in rapids and cascades.</p>

<p>An enormous hollow, covering an area of ten square miles, and more than 3,000
feet in depth, occupies a portion of the western slope of the volcano. This is the
Val di Bove, a vast amphitheatre of explosion, the bottom of which is dotted over
with subsidiary craters, and which rises in gigantic steps, over which, when the
mountain is in a state of eruption, pour fiery cascades of lava. Lyell has shown
that this Val di Bove is the ancient crater of Mount Etna, but that, at some
period not known to us, the existing terminal vent opened a couple of miles farther
west. The steep sides of the Val di Bove enable us to gain a considerable insight
into the history of the volcano, for the various layers of lava may be studied there
at leisure. The cliffs upon which stands the town of Aci Reale afford a similar
opportunity for embracing at one glance a long period of its history. These cliffs,
over 300 feet in height, consist of seven distinct layers of lava, successively poured
forth from the bowels of Mount Etna. Each layer consists nearly throughout
of a compact mass, affording no hold for the roots of plants, but their surfaces
have invariably been converted into tufa, or even mould, owing to atmospheric
agencies which operated for centuries after each eruption. It has likewise been
proved not only that these cliffs increased in height in consequence of successive
eruptions, but that they were also repeatedly upheaved from below. Lines of
erosion resulting from the action of the waves can be distinctly traced at various
elevations above the present level of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. The lavas, too, have
undergone a change of structure since they were poured forth, as is proved by
beautiful caverns enclosed by prismatic columns of basalt, and by the islet of the
Cyclops, near Aci Trezza.</p>

<p>During the last two thousand years Mount Etna has had more than a
hundred eruptions, some of them continuing for a number of years. Hitherto it
has not been possible to trace any regularity in these eruptions. They appear to
occur at irregular intervals, and the quantity of lava poured forth from the principal
or any subsidiary cone varies exceedingly. The most considerable stream
of lava of which we have any record was that which overwhelmed the city of
Catania in 1669. It first converted the fields of Nicolosi into a fiery lake, then
enveloped a portion of the hill of Monpilieri, which for a time arrested its progress,
and finally divided into three separate streams, the principal of which descended
upon Catania. It swept away a part of that town, filled up its port, and formed a
promontory in its stead. The quantity of lava poured forth on that occasion has
been estimated at 3,532 millions of cubic feet; and nearly 40 square miles of
fertile land, supporting a population of 20,000 souls, were converted into a stony
waste. The double cone of Monti Rossi, with its beautiful crater now grown over
with golden-flowered broom, was formed by the ashes ejected during that great
eruption. More than 700 subsidiary cones, similar to the Monti Rossi, are
scattered over the exterior slopes of Mount Etna, and bear witness to as many
eruptions. The most ancient amongst them have been nearly
obliterated in the <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
course of ages, or buried beneath streams of lava, but the others still retain their
conical shape, and rise to a height of many hundred feet. Several amongst them
are now covered with forests, and the craters of others have been converted into
gardens—delightful cup-shaped hollows, where villas shine like gems set in
verdure.</p>

<p>Most of these subsidiary cones lie at an elevation of between 3,300 and 6,500
feet above the sea, and it is there the internal forces make themselves most strongly
felt. As a rule the subterranean activity is less violent near the summit, and
during most of the eruptions the great terminal crater merely serves as a vent,
through which the aqueous vapours and gases make their escape. Fumaroles
surrounding it convert the soil into a kind of pap, and the substances which escape
from them streak the scoriæ with brilliant colours—scarlet, yellow, and emerald
green. The internal heat makes itself felt on many parts of the exterior slopes.
It converts loose rocks into a compact mass, far less difficult to climb than are
the loose cinders of Mount Vesuvius. Travellers ascending the mountain need
fear nothing from volcanic bombs. Showers of stone are occasionally ejected from
the principal vent, but this is quite an exceptional occurrence. If it were not so,
the small structure above the precipices of the Val di Bove, which
dates from the <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
time of the Romans, and is known as the “Philosopher’s Tower,” would long ago
have been buried beneath débris. A meteorological observatory might therefore be
established with safety on the summit of this mountain, and no better station could
be found for giving warning of approaching storms.</p>

<p>The summit of Mount Etna, 10,866 feet in height, does not penetrate the zone
of perennial snow, and the heat emitted from the subterranean focus soon melts
the incipient glaciers which accumulate in hollows. Nevertheless the upper half
of the mountain is covered with a shroud of white during a great part of the year.
It might be imagined that the snow and copious rains would give birth to numerous
rivulets descending from the slopes of the volcano; but the small stones and
cinders which cover the solid beds of lava promptly absorb all moisture, and
springs are met with only in a few favoured spots. They are abundant on
the lower slopes, or in the immediate vicinity of the sea. One of these is the
fountain of Acis, which issues from the chaos of rocks which Polyphemus is
said to have hurled at the ships of sage Ulysses. Another gives birth to the
river Amenano, which rises in the town of Catania, and hastens in silvery cascades
towards its port. When we look at these clear springs in the midst of black sands
and burnt rocks we are able to comprehend the fancy of the ancient Greeks, who
regarded them as divine beings, in whose honour they struck medals and raised
statues.</p>

<p>Though running streams are scarcely met with on the slopes of Mount Etna,
its cinders retain a sufficient quantity of moisture to support a luxuriant vegetation.
The mountain is clad with verdure except where the surface of the lava is too
compact to be penetrated by the roots of plants. Only the highest regions, which
are covered with snow during the greater part of the year, are
barren. It is <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span>
a remarkable fact that the flora of the Alps should not be met with on Mount Etna,
although the temperature suits it exactly.</p>

<p>Formerly the volcano was surrounded by a belt of forests occupying the zone
between the cultivated lands and the region of snow and cinders. Such is the
case no longer. On the southern slope, which is that usually ascended by tourists,
there are no forests at all, and only the trunk of some ancient oak is occasionally
met with. On the other slopes groves of trees are more frequent, particularly in
the north, where there remain a few lofty trees, which impart quite an alpine
character to the scenery. But the wood-cutters prosecute their work of extermination
without mercy, and it is to be feared that the time is not very distant
when even the last vestiges of the ancient forests will have disappeared. The
magnificent chestnuts on the western slopes, amongst which could be admired until
recently the “tree of the hundred horses,” bear witness to the astonishing fertility
of the lava. If the cultivators of the soil only desired it, a few years would
suffice to restore to Mount Etna its ancient covering of foliage.</p>

<p>The cultivated zone occupying the lower slopes of the mountains presents in
many places the appearance of a beautiful garden. There are groves of olive,
orange, lemon, and other fruit trees, in the midst of which rise clumps of palms,
and villas, churches, and monasteries peep out from this mass of verdure. The
fertility of the soil is so great that it supports a population three or four times more
numerous than that in any other part of Italy. More than 300,000 inhabitants
dwell on the slopes of a mountain which might be supposed to inspire terror, and
which actually bursts at intervals, burying fertile fields beneath a fiery deluge.
Town succeeds town along its base like pearls in a necklace, and when a stream
of lava effects a breach in this chain of human habitations it is closed up again as
soon as the lava has had time to cool. From the rim of the crater the mountain
climber looks down with astonishment upon these human ant-hills. The concentric
zones of houses and verdure contrast curiously with the snows and ashes
occupying the centre of the picture, and with the barren limestone rocks beyond
the Simeto. And this is only a small portion of the vast and marvellous prospect,
embracing a radius of 124 miles. Well may the beholder be enchanted by the
unrivalled spectacle of three seas, of a deeper blue than the skies, washing the
shores of Sicily, of Calabria, and of the Æolian Islands.</p>

<p>Mount Pelorus, which forms a continuation of the chain of the Aspromonte of
Calabria, is of very inferior height to Mount Etna, but it had existed for ages
when the space now occupied by the volcano was only a bay of the sea. It
was formerly believed that a crater existed on the highest summit of Pelorus
dedicated to Neptune, and now to the “Mother of God,” or <i>Dinna Mare</i>
(3,600 feet), but such is not the case. These mountains consist of primitive and
transition rocks, with beds of limestone and marble on their flanks. They first
follow the coast of the Ionian Sea, where they form numerous steep promontories,
and then, turning abruptly towards the west, run parallel with that of the Æolian
Sea. Their culminating point, near the centre, is known as Madonia (6,336 feet),
and the magnificent forests which still clothe it impart to that part
of the island <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span>
quite a northern aspect, and we might almost fancy ourselves in the Apennines or
Maritime Alps. Limestone promontories of the most varied profile advance into
the blue waters of the sea, and render this coast one of the most beautiful of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean. We are seized with admiration when we behold the enormous
quadrangular block of Cefalù, the more undulating hill of Termini, the vertical
masses of Coltafano, and above all, near Palermo, the natural fortress of Monte
Pellegrino (1,970 feet), an almost inaccessible rock, upon which Hamilcar Barca
resisted for three years the efforts of a Roman army to dislodge him. Monte San
Giuliano (2,300 feet), an almost isolated limestone summit, terminates this chain
in the west. It is the Eryx of the ancients, who dedicated it to Venus.</p>

<p>The mountains which branch off from this main chain towards the south gradually
decrease in height as they approach the sea. The principal slopes of the
island descend towards the Ionian and Sicilian Seas, and all its perennial rivers—the
Platani, Salso, and Simeto—flow in these directions. The rivers on the
northern slope are mere <i>fiumare</i>, formidable after heavy rains, but lost in beds of
shingle during the dry season. The lakes and swamps of the island are likewise
confined to the southern slope of the mountains. Amongst them are the <i>pantani</i>,
and the Lake, or <i>biviere</i>, of Lentini, which is the most extensive sheet of water in
Sicily; the Lake of Pergusa, or Enna, formerly surrounded by flowery meadows in
which Proserpine was seized by Pluto; the <i>biviere</i> of Terranova; and several
marshy tracts, the remains of ancient bays of the sea. This southern coast of the
island contrasts most unfavourably with the northern, for, in the place of picturesque
promontories of the most varied outline, we meet with a monotonous sandy
shore, devoid of all shade. Natural harbours are scarce there, and during the
winter storms vessels frequenting it are exposed to much danger.</p>

<p>The southern slope of Sicily, to the south of the Madonia, consists of tertiary
and more recent rocks, abounding in fossil shells mostly belonging to species still
living in the neighbouring sea. In the hills to the south of Catania these tertiary
rocks alternate with strata of volcanic origin, which are evidently derived from
submarine eruptions. This process is still going on between Girgenti and the
island of Pantellaria, where the submarine volcano of Giulia or Ferdinandea occasionally
rises above the surface of the sea. It was seen in 1801, and thirty years
later it had another eruption, resulting in the formation of an island four miles in
circumference, which was examined by Jussieu and Constant Prévost. In 1863 it
appeared for the third time. But the waves of the sea have always washed away
the ashes and cinders ejected on these occasions, spreading them in regular layers
over the bottom of the sea, and thus producing an alternation of strata similar to
that observed at Catania. In 1840 the summit of this submarine volcano was
covered with only six feet of water, but recently no soundings were obtained at a
depth of fifty fathoms.</p>

</div><!--dctr-->

<p>This submarine volcano is not the only witness to the activity of subterranean
forces in Southern Italy. We meet there with mineral springs discharging
carbonic acid and other gases, which prove fatal to the smaller animals venturing
within their influence, and with a naphtha lake near Palagonia,
from which escape, <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
likewise, irrespirable gases. A similar phenomenon may be witnessed in
connection with the Lake of Pergusa, which occupies an ancient crater about four
miles in circumference, and usually abounds in tench and eels. From time to
time, however, an escape of poisonous gases appears to take place from the bottom
of the lake, which kills the fish, whose carcasses rise to the surface. Another
of these <i>salses</i> has made its appearance farther west, near
the Palazzo Adriano, <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span>
and, indeed, the whole of underground Sicily appears to be in a state of chemical
effervescence.</p>

<p>Next to Mount Etna the great centre of volcanic activity in Sicily appears to
be near Girgenti, at a place known as the <i>Maccalubas</i>. The aspect of this spot
changes with the seasons. In summer bubbles of gas escape from small
craters filled with liquid mud, which occasionally overflows, and runs down the
exterior slopes. The rains of winter almost obliterate these miniature volcanoes,
and the plain is then converted into one mass of mud, from which the gases escape.
At the beginning of this century the soil was occasionally shaken by earthquakes,
and on these occasions jets of mud and stones were ejected to a height of ten or
twenty yards. The Maccalubas appear now to be in a state of quiescence, for
these mud volcanoes also seem to have their regular periods of rest and activity.</p>

<p>The deposits of sulphur, which constitute one of the riches of Sicily, undoubtedly
owe their existence to these subterranean lakes of seething lava. These
sulphur beds are met with in the tertiary strata extending from Centorbi to
Cattolica, in the province of Girgenti. They date from the epoch of the Upper
Miocene, and are deposited upon layers of fossil infusoria exhaling a bituminous
odour. Geologists are not yet agreed on the origin of these sulphur beds, but it
is most likely that they are derived from sulphate of lime carried to the surface
by hot springs. In the same formation beds of gypsum and of rock-salt are
met with, and the latter may frequently be traced from a saline effervescence
known as <i>occhi di sale</i> (“eyes of salt”).</p>

<p>Sicily, like Greece, enjoys one of the happiest climates. The heat of summer
is tempered by sea breezes which blow regularly during the hottest part of each
day. The cold of winter would not be felt at all if it were not for the total
absence of every comfort in the houses, for ice is not known, and snow exceedingly
rare. The autumn rains are abundant, but there are many fine days even during
that season. The prevailing winds from the north and west are salubrious, but
the <i>sirocco</i>, which usually blows towards the south-east, is deadly, especially when it
reaches the northern coast. It generally blows for three or four days, and during
that time no one thinks of clarifying wine, salting meat, or painting houses or
furniture. This wind is the great drawback to the climate. In some parts of
Sicily the exhalations from the swamps are dangerous, but this is entirely the fault
of man. It is owing to his neglect that Agosta and Syracuse suffer from fevers,
and that death forbids the stranger to approach the ruins of ancient Himera.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn109" id="fnanch109">109</a></p>

<p>Temperature and moisture impart to the vegetation of the plains and lower
valleys a semi-tropical aspect. Many plants of Asia and Africa have become
acclimatized in Sicily. Groups of date-palms are seen in the gardens, and the
plains around Sciacca, almost African in their appearance, abound in groves of dwarf
palms, or <i>giummare</i>, to which ancient Selinus was indebted for its epithet of
<i>Palmosa</i>. Cotton grows on the slopes of the hills up to a height of 600 feet above
the sea; bananas, sugar-cane, and bamboos do not require
the shelter of <span class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span>
greenhouses; the <i>Victoria regia</i> covers the ponds with its huge leaves and flowers; the
papyrus of the Nile, which is not known anywhere else in Europe, chokes up the
bed of the Anapo, near Syracuse: formerly it grew also in the Oreto, near Palermo,
but it does so no longer. The cactus of Barbary (<i>Cactus opuntia</i>) has become the
most characteristic plant of the coast districts of Sicily, and is rapidly covering the
most unpromising beds of lava. These and other plants flourish most luxuriantly on
the southern slopes of Mount Etna, where the orange-tree bears fruit at a height
of 1,700 feet, and the larch ascends even to 7,400 feet. These slopes facing
the African sun are the hottest spots in Europe, for the volcano shelters them
from the winds of the north, whilst its dark-coloured scoriæ and cinders absorb
the rays of the mid-day sun.</p>

<p>Those portions of Sicily which are clothed with trees or shrubs are always
green, for orange-trees, olive-trees, carob-trees, laurels, mastic-trees, tamarisks,
cypresses, and pines retain their verdure even in winter, when nature wears a
desolate aspect in our own latitudes. There is no “season,” so to say, for with a
little care all kinds of vegetables can be had throughout the year. The gardens
around Syracuse are famous above all others, because of the striking manner in
which they contrast with the naked rocks surrounding them. The most delightful
amongst them is the <i>Intagliatella</i>, or <i>Latomia de’ Greci</i>, which occupies an old quarry
where Greek slaves dressed the stones used in erecting the palaces of Syracuse.
The vegetation there is most luxuriant; the trunks of the trees rise above masses
of shrubs, their branches are covered with creeping plants, flowers and ripening
fruit cover the paths, and birds without number sing in the foliage. This earthly
paradise is surrounded by precipitous walls of rock covered with ivy, or bare and
white as on the day when Athenian slaves were at work there.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Sicily lies on the high-road of all the nations who ever disputed the command of
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and its population consequently consists of a mixture of the
most heterogeneous elements. Irrespectively of Sicani, Siculi, and other aboriginal
nations, whose position amongst the European family is uncertain, but who
probably spoke a language akin to that of the Latins, we know that Phœnicians
and Carthaginians successively settled on its shores, and that the Greeks were
almost as numerous there as in their native country. Twenty-five centuries have
passed since the Greeks founded their first colony, Naxos, at the foot of Mount
Etna. Soon afterwards Syracuse, Leontini, Catania, Megara Hyblæa, Messina, and
other colonies sprang into existence, until the whole of the littoral region was in
the hands of the Greeks, the native populations being pushed back into the interior.
In Sicily the Greek met with the same climate, and with rocks and mountains
similar in aspect to those of his native home. The “Marmorean” port and the
wide bay of Syracuse, the acropolis and Mount Hybla, do they not recall Attica or
the Peloponnesus? The fountain of Arethusa, on the island of Ortygia, which is
supplied through underground channels, reminds us of the fountain of Erasinos and
of many others in Hellas, which find their way through fissures in the limestone
rocks to the seashore. The Syracusans said that the river
Alpheus, enamoured of <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span>
the nymph Arethusa, did not mingle its waters with those of the Ionian, but found
its way through subterranean channels to the coast of Sicily, where it rose again
at the side of the fountain dedicated to the object of his adoration, bringing
the flowers and fruits of beloved Greece. This legend bears testimony to the
great love which the Greek bore his native land, whose very fountains and
plants were supposed to follow him into his new home.</p>

<p>If we may judge from the number of inhabitants with which the principal
towns were credited at that time, Sicily must have had a population of several
millions of Greeks. The Carthaginian merchants and soldiers, on the other hand,
though they were the masters of portions of the island for two or three centuries,
never settled upon it, and only a few walls, coins, and inscriptions bear witness now
of their ever having been present. It has been very judiciously remarked by
M. Dennis that the most striking evidence of their reign is presented in the
desolate sites of the cities of Himera and Selinus. At the same time we must not
forget that the Carthaginians, by intermingling with the existing population,
materially affected the ulterior destinies of the island. The Romans, who held
Sicily for nearly seven centuries, did so in a still higher degree. Vandals and
Goths likewise left traces behind them. The Saracens, themselves a mixed race,
imparted their Southern impetuosity to the Sicilians, whilst their conquerors, the
Normans, endowed them with the daring and indomitable courage which at that
period animated these sons of the North. In 1071, when the Normans laid siege
to Palermo, no less than five languages were spoken on the island, viz. Arabic,
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and vulgar Sicilian. But Arabic was the tongue of the
civilised inhabitants, and even during the dominion of the Normans inscriptions
upon palaces and churches were written in it. It was at the court of King
Roger that Edrisi wrote his “Geography,” one of the great monuments of science.
In 1223 the last Arabs were made to emigrate to Naples, but by that time much
Arab blood already flowed through the veins of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Later on, the character of the population was still further modified by French,
Germans, Spaniards, and Aragonese, and all this helped to make them a people
differing in appearance, manners, habits, and feelings from their Italian neighbours.
These islanders look upon every inhabitant of the mainland as a foreigner.
The absence of roads on the island enabled the different groups of its population
to maintain their distinct idioms and character during a very long period. The
Lombards whom the Romans transplanted to Benevento and Palermo spoke their
native dialect long after it had become extinct in Lombardy. Even now there
are about 50,000 Sicilians who speak this ancient Lombard tongue. At San
Fratello, on a steep hill on the northern coast, this idiom is spoken with the
greatest purity. Nor has the Italian wholly supplanted the vulgar Sicilian in the
interior of the island. We meet with many Greek and Arab words. One of the
most curious words is that of <i>val</i>, which is applied to various districts of Sicily,
and is supposed to have been derived from <i>vali</i>, the Arab term for “governor.”
The Sicilian idiom is less sonorous than the Italian. Vowels standing between
consonants are frequently suppressed, and the <i>o</i>, and even the <i>a</i> and
<i>i</i> (<i>ee</i>), are <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span>
changed into <i>oo</i>, which renders the speech hard and indistinct. The language
lends itself, however, admirably to poetry, and the Sicilian popular songs are quite
equal in natural grace and delicacy to the much-admired <i>rispetti</i> of Tuscany.</p>

<p>Of all the emigrants who have settled on the island the Albanians alone have
not become merged in the general population. Locally known as Greci, they still
form separate communities, speaking their own language and observing special
religious rites, in several of the towns of the interior, and more especially at
Piana de’ Greci, which occupies a commanding hill to the south of Palermo.
Nor is the fusion amongst the other races as complete as it appears to be at the
first glance. The population around Mount Etna, who are, perhaps, more purely
Greek in blood than the Greeks themselves, are noted for their grace, gaiety, and
sweetness of disposition. They are the most intelligent portion of the population
of Sicily. Those of Trapani and San Giuliani are said to be the best-looking, and
their women delight the stranger by the regularity and beauty of their features.
The Palermitans, on the other hand, in whose veins flows much Arab blood, are
for the most part unprepossessing in their appearance. They open their house but
rarely to strangers, and jealously shut up their women in its most retired part.</p>

<p>The most ferocious usages of war, piracy, and brigandage have kept their
ground longer at Palermo and its environs than anywhere else. The laws of the
<i>omerta</i>, or “men of heart,” make vengeance a duty. <i>A chi ti toglie il pane, e tu
toglili la vita&#x202f;!</i> (“Take the life of him who has taken your bread&#x202f;!”) is its fundamental
principle; but in practice Palermitan vengeance is far from possessing the
simplicity of the Corsican vendetta, for it is complicated by the most atrocious
cruelties. No less than four or five thousand Palermitans are said to be affiliated
to the secret league of the <i>maffia</i>, whose members subsist upon every kind of
roguery. Up to 1865 the brigands were masters in the environs of that town.
They virtually laid siege to the town, separating it from its more distant suburbs.
Strangers were afraid to leave lest they should be murdered or captured by
bandits; and no farmer could harvest his corn or olives, or shear his sheep,
without paying toll to these highwaymen. More than ten years have passed
since then, but in spite of measures of exceptional severity the maffia still exists.</p>

<p>The history of this association, which dates its origin back to the time of the
Norman kings, remains yet to be written. It has always flourished most in time
of political troubles, and consequent misery. No doubt things have grown worse
in the course of the last twenty years; taxes have been increased, the conscription
established, and many abrupt changes, such as are inseparable from a new
political regimen, have been introduced. The people, accustomed to put up with
ancient abuses, have not yet learnt to bear the burdens imposed in connection
with the annexation of the island to the kingdom of Italy. Nevertheless the
Sicilians grow more Italian from day to day. Community of language and of
interests attaches the island to the peninsula, and the time is not far distant when
both countries will gravitate in the same orbit. Italy is most highly interested in
establishing feelings of friendship with the inhabitants of the island, and in developing
its resources. The rapid increase of the population, which is
said to have <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span>
tripled since 1734, bears witness to the great natural riches of the country; and
what might not be achieved if the barbarous processes now in force there were
superseded by the scientific methods of our own time?</p>

<p>Sicily was the favourite haunt of Ceres, and in the plain of Catania this
beneficent goddess taught man the art of cultivating the soil. The Sicilians have
not forgotten this teaching, for nearly half the area is covered with corn-fields;
but they have not improved their system of cultivation since those fabulous times,
and improvements can hardly be effected as long as the restrictions imposed by
the feudal tenure introduced by the Normans are allowed to exist. The agricultural
implements are of a primitive kind, manure is hardly known, and the
fate of the crops depends entirely upon nature. When travelling through the
country districts of Sicily, we are struck by not meeting with isolated houses.
There are no villages, for all the cultivators of the soil live in towns, and are
content to travel daily to their fields, which are occasionally at a distance of six
miles. Sometimes they pass the night there, in a cavern or a ditch covered
with boughs, and at harvest-time the labourers sleep in improvised sheds. This
absence of human habitations imparts an air of solemn sadness to vast corn-fields
covering valleys and slopes, and we almost fancy we are wandering through a
deserted country, and wonder for whose benefit the crops are ripening.</p>

<p>Corn-fields cover a greater area than that devoted to the cultivation of all
other objects put together; nevertheless the latter articles represent a higher
pecuniary value. The orchards, vineyards, and gardens near the towns are a
far greater source of wealth than the distant corn-fields. In former times wheat
was the principal article of export; now Sicily is no longer a granary, but promises
to become a vast emporium of fruit. Even now the crop of oranges grown there,
which consists of seven kinds, subdivided into four hundred varieties, represents a
value of £2,000,000 a year. The marvellous gardens which surround Palermo are
steadily increasing at the expense of the ancient plantations of ash, and ascend
the hills to a height of 1,150 feet. Hundreds of millions of oranges are exported
annually to Continental Europe, England, and America, and the inferior sorts are
converted into essential oils, citric acid, or citrate of lime. The last is used in
printing stuffs, and Sicily enjoys a monopoly in its manufacture.</p>

<p>Sicily likewise occupies a foremost place as a vine-growing country, and
supplies more than a fourth of the wine produced throughout Italy. The cultivation
of the vine, which is carried on to a large extent by foreigners, is much better
understood there than on the neighbouring peninsula, and the wines exported
from Marsala, Syracuse, Alcamo, and Milazzo are justly held in high estimation.
Excellent wine is also grown on the southern and western slopes of Mount Etna,
to which the heat of the sun imparts much fire. England and non-Italian Europe
are the great consumers of the wines of Sicily, as they are of its oils, almonds,
cotton, saffron, sumach, and manna, extracted, like that of the Calabrias, from a
kind of ash. Raw silk, which Sicily was the first to produce in Europe, is likewise
exported in considerable quantities.</p>

<p>Sulphur is the great mineral product of the island. The beds
vary much in <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
richness, but even where they contain only five or six per cent. a light brought to the
walls of the mine will cause the sulphur to boil like pitch. The blocks extracted
from the mine are piled up in the open air, where they remain exposed to the
destructive action of the atmosphere. The fragments are then heaped up over the
flame of a furnace, which causes the stones to split, the melted sulphur flowing
into moulds placed beneath. By this primitive process only two-thirds of the
sulphur contained in the rock are extracted, but it proves nevertheless most
remunerative. About 200,000 tons of sulphur, or more than two-thirds of the
sulphur required for manufacturing purposes throughout Europe, are annually
exported from Sicily, and the known deposits of the island have been computed
to contain from 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 tons. To the north of Girgenti and
in other parts of Sicily sulphureous plaster has been used in the construction of
the houses, and the atmosphere there is at all times impregnated with an odour
of sulphur.</p>

<p>Rock-salt is met with in the same formations as the sulphur, and in
quantities almost inexhaustible, but salt is not a rare article, and even the Sicilians
prefer to gather it from the salt swamps extending along the coast, the most
productive of which are near Trapani, at the western extremity of the island. At
the same spot the sea yields the best coral of Sicily. The tunny fishery is carried
on mostly in the great bays between Trapani and Palermo, while most of the swordfish
are captured in the Strait of Messina. The seas of Sicily abound in fish,
and the islanders boast of being the most expert fishermen of the Western
Me­di­ter­ra­nean.</p>

<p>Until recently communications in Sicily were kept up almost exclusively by sea.
In 1866 the only carriage road of the island, which connects Messina with
Palermo, was hardly made use of by travellers, and even now the most important
mines of sulphur and salt communicate with the seashore only by mule-paths;
and the inhabitants are actually opposed to the construction of roads, from fear of
their interfering with the existing modes of transport. The road which connects
the harbour of Terranova with Caltanissetta has been under construction for
twenty years, although it is the only one which joins the interior of the country
to the sea-coast. Railways to some extent supply this deficiency of roads, but are
being built very slowly, hardly more than 250 miles being at present open for
traffic.</p>

<p>Palermo the “happy,” the capital of Sicily, is one of the great towns of Italy.
At the time of the Arabs it surpassed all towns of the peninsula in population, but
at present, though increasing rapidly, it yields to Naples, Milan, and Rome. No
other town of Europe can boast of an equally delicious climate, nor is any fairer to
look upon from a distance. Bold barren mountains enclose a marvellous garden,
the famous “shell of gold” (<i>conca d’oro</i>), from the midst of which rise towers
and domes, palms with fan-shaped leaves, and pines, commanded in the south by
the huge ecclesiastical edifices of Monreale. Termini is the only city of Sicily
which rivals Palmero in the beauty of its site, and it truly merits its epithet of
<i>splendissime</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span></p>

</div><!--dctr-->

<p>But the beauty of the country contrasts most painfully with the misery and
filth reigning in most of the quarters of the capital. Palermo has its sumptuous
edifices. It boasts of a cathedral lavishly decorated; its royal palace and palatine
chapel, covered with mosaics, and harmoniously combining the beauties of
Byzantine, Moorish, and Roman art, are unique of their kind; the church of
Monreale, in one of its suburbs, may challenge Ravenna by the number of its
mosaics. There are Moorish palaces, a few modern monuments, and two broad
streets, which a Spanish governor had made in the shape of a cross. But, besides
these, we only meet with dark and narrow streets and wretched tenements, the
windows of which are stuffed with rags. Down to a recent period Palermo was undeserving
its Greek name of “Port of all Nations.” Enclosed within mountains, and
having no communications with the interior, its commerce was merely local, and
its exports were limited to the produce of its fisheries and of
its gardens. Though <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
far more populous than Genoa, its commerce is only half that of the Ligurian city,
but it is rapidly on the increase.</p>

<p>Trapani, a colony of the Carthaginians like Palermo, and Marsala, so famous for
its wines, at the western extremity of the island, are proportionately far busier
than the capital. Trapani, built on a sickle-shaped promontory, carries on a lively
trade. The salt marshes near it are amongst the most productive in all Italy;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn110" id="fnanch110">110</a>
tunny, coral, and sponge fishing is carried on; and the artisans of the town are
skilled as weavers, masons, and jewellers. The harbour is one of the best in Italy;
the roadstead is well sheltered by the outlying Ægadian Islands; and the ambition
of the inhabitants, who look forward to a time when Trapani will be the
principal emporium for the trade with Tunis, is likely to be realized on the completion
of a railway to Messina. The harbour of Mazzara, the outlet for the produce
of the inland towns of Castelvetrano and Salemi, lies closer to Tunis, but its shelter
is indifferent. As to Marsala—the “Mars ed Allah,” or God’s haven, of the Arabs—its
port was filled up by Charles V., and has only recently been reconstructed.
It is, however, not of sufficient depth for large vessels, and only salt and wine are
exported from it to France and England. Marsala occupies the site of the ancient
city of Lilybæum, which had a population of 900,000 souls when Diodorus Siculus
wrote his Geography. It has recently become famous in consequence of the
landing there of Garibaldi and his thousand followers in 1860, and its being
the spot from which they entered upon the triumphant march which ended in the
battle of the Volturno and the capture of Gaeta.</p>

<p>Messina the “noble” is the great commercial centre of Sicily, and the only
port of that island where vessels of all nations meet. Messina is a stage on the
ocean high-roads which join or connect Western Europe and the Levant. Its
roadstead is one of the safest, and vessels in distress are certain to find protection
there. Moreover, vessels coming from the Tyrrhenian, and fearful of encountering
the dangerous currents of the strait during a storm, may easily find shelter at
Milazzo, to the north of it. The port of Messina is formed by a sickle-shaped
tongue of land, making a natural breakwater.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn111" id="fnanch111">111</a> There are few cities in Europe
which are more exposed to the destructive action of earthquakes than Messina,
and the traces of the great shock of 1783, which swamped the vessels in the
harbour, undermined the palaces along the seashore, and caused the death of
more than a thousand persons, have not yet entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Catania, the sub-Etnean, as its Greek name implies, is menaced not only by
earthquakes, but also by volcanic eruptions. It, too, enjoys a high amount of
commercial prosperity, and exports the surplus produce of the towns situated at
the foot of the volcano, among which are Acireale, with its orange groves; Giarre,
with its dusty streets; Paterno, abounding in
thermal springs; Aderno, on the <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span>
summit of a rock of lava; Bronte, at the junction of two streams of scoriæ; and
Randazza, commanded by an ancient Norman castle. Catania also monopolizes
the export of the produce of the inland districts of Eastern Sicily; it is the great
railway centre of the island, and several carriage roads converge upon it. Its port
has grown too small for the business carried on there, and it is proposed to enlarge
it by means of piers and breakwaters.</p>

<p>It is quite natural that on an island, no locality of which is more than forty miles
from the sea, all great towns should be met with on the coast, where there are
greater facilities for commerce. Still a few centres of population sprang up in the
interior, either in the midst of the most fertile districts or at the crossings of the
most-frequented lines of communication. Nicosia, the Lombard city, is thus a
natural place of passage between Catania and the northern coast of the island.
Corleone occupies a similar position with respect to Palermo and
the African slope <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
of the island. Castro Giovanni, the ancient Enna, likewise occupies a privileged
position, for it stands on an elevated plateau in the very centre of the island: a large
stone near it is said by the inhabitants to be an ancient altar of Ceres. Piazza
Armerina <i>l’opulentissime</i>, and Caltagirone, surnamed <i>la gratissima</i> on account of
the fertility of its fields, are both populous towns, which carry on a considerable
commerce through Terranova, in the building of which the stones of the old temples
of Gela have been utilised. Caltanissetta, farther to the west, and its neighbour
Canicatti, export their produce through the port of Licata.</p>

<p>In the south-eastern corner of Sicily there are likewise several inland towns of
some importance, amongst which Ragusa and Modica are the most considerable.
Comiso, an industrious place, lies farther to the west, and is surrounded by cotton
plantations. The valley of the Hipparis, sung by Pindar, separates it from
Vittoria, the saline plains of which furnish much of the soda exported to
Marseilles. Noto, like most towns in that part of Sicily, is at some distance from
the coast, but its twin city, Avola, stands upon the shore of the Ionian Sea. Noto
and Avola were both overthrown by the earthquake of 1693, and have been
rebuilt with geometrical regularity near their former sites. The fields of Avola,
though not very fertile by nature, are amongst the best cultivated of the island,
and it is there only that the production of the sugar-cane has attained to any
importance.</p>

<p>On the northern slope of the hills forming the back-bone of the island there
are several other towns inhabited by the agricultural population. Lentini, the
ancient Leontini, which boasts of being the oldest city in the island, is at present
only a poor place, having been wholly rebuilt since the earthquake of 1693.
Militello has been restored since the same epoch, and Grammicheli was founded in
the eighteenth century to afford a shelter for the inhabitants of Occhiala, which was
destroyed by an earthquake. Vizzini and Licodia di Vizzini are remarkable on
account of the beds of lava near them, which alternate with layers of marine fossils,
and Mineo stands near a small crater of the swamp of Palici. The popular songs
of Mineo are famous throughout Sicily. The marvellous “stone of poetry” is
shown near it, and all those who kiss it are said to become poets.</p>

<p>Southern Sicily is poor in natural ports, and formerly, along the whole of that
part of the coast which faces Africa, there were only open roadsteads and beaches.
On the Ionian coast, however, two excellent harbours are met with, viz. those of
Agosta and Syracuse, which are very much like each other in outline and general
features. Agosta, or Augusta, the successor of the Greek city of Megara Hyblæa,
is now nothing more than a fortress besieged by fever. Syracuse, the ancient
city of the Dorians, and at one time the most populous and wealthy city of
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, has been reduced to a simple provincial capital. That
city, whose inhabitants even during the last century celebrated their great
victory over the Athenians, is now hardly more than a heap of ruins. Its
“marble port,” formerly surrounded by statues, is now frequented only by small
boats, and its great harbour, large enough for contending squadrons, lies
deserted. All that remains of it is contained in the small
island of Ortygia, <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
separated from the mainland by fortifications, a ditch, and the swamps of
Syraca. The vast peninsula of limestone formerly occupied by the city is at present
inhabited only by a few farmers, whose houses stand near the canals of irrigation.
The grand edifices erected by the inhabitants of ancient Syracuse are
now represented by the ruins of columns on the banks of the Anapo rising from
the “azure” fountain of Cyane; by the fortifications of the Epipolæ and Euryelum
erected by Archimedes, and now known as Belvedere; by the remains of baths, an
enormous altar large enough for hecatombs of sacrifices, an amphitheatre, and an
admirable theatre for 25,000 spectators, who were able to see at a
glance from their <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
seats the whole of the ancient city, with its temples and fleets of merchantmen.
Nothing, however, is better calculated to convey an idea of the ancient grandeur
of the city than the vast quarries or <i>lautumiæ</i> and the subterranean catacombs,
more extensive than those of Naples, and not yet wholly explored. In former
times the summit of the island of Ortygia was occupied by an acropolis, in which
stood a temple of Minerva, a rival of the Parthenon of Athens. Sailors, on leaving
the port, were bound to look towards this temple, holding in their hands a vase of
burning charcoal taken from the altar of Juno, which they flung into the sea
when they lost sight of it. Portions of the temple still exist, but its beautiful
columns have been covered with plaster and incorporated in an ugly church.</p>

<p>There are other Hellenic ruins in Sicily, which, in the eyes of artists, make that
island a worthy rival of Greece itself. Girgenti, the
ancient Acragas, or <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
Agrigentum, which numbered its inhabitants by hundreds of thousands, but is now a
poor place like Syracuse, possesses ruins of at least ten temples or religious edifices,
of which that dedicated to Olympian Jupiter was the largest in all Italy, and
has been made use of in the construction of the present mole. Another, that
dedicated to Concord, is in a better state of preservation than any other Greek
temple outside the limits of Hellas. The modern city occupies merely the site of
the ancient acropolis, and is built upon a layer of shelly sandstone, which descends
in steps towards the sea. The cathedral has been built from materials taken from
a temple of Jupiter Atabyrios, and its baptismal font is an ancient sarcophagus
upon which are represented the loves of Phædra and Hippolytus. In former times
Agrigentum reached to within a couple of miles from the sea. The modern port,
named in honour of one of the most famous sons of the city, lies to the west of the
ancient Hellenic <i>Emporium</i>, at a distance of four miles from the city. It is the
busiest harbour on the southern coast, and large quantities of sulphur are exported
from it (see Fig. <a href="#fg117" title="go to Fig. 117">117</a>,
p. 317).</p>

<p>Sciacca, another seaside town farther to the west, in one of those localities of
the island most exposed to earthquakes, boasts of being the modern representative
of Selinus, though that Greek city was situated about fourteen miles farther west,
to the south of Castelvetrano. Its seven temples have been overthrown by earthquakes,
but they still present us with remains of the purest Doric style. The
metopes of three of them have been conveyed to Palermo, where they form the
most precious ornaments of the museum.</p>

<p>Segesta, on the north coast, no longer exists, but there still remain the ruins of
a magnificent temple. Other remains of Greek art abound in all parts of the
island, and there are also monuments erected by the Romans. If we contrast
these ancient edifices with those raised since by Byzantines, Moors, Normans, Spaniards,
and Neapolitans, we are bound to admit that the latter exhibit no progress,
but decadence. Alas&#x202f;! how very much inferior are the inhabitants of modern
Syracuse in comparison with the fellow-citizens of an Archimedes&#x202f;!</p>

<p>Sicily offers most striking examples of towns changing their positions in consequence
of political disturbances. When the ancient Greek cities were at the
height of their power they boldly descended to the very coast; but when war and
rapine got the upper hand—when Moorish pirates scoured the sea, and brigandage
reigned in the interior—then it was that most of the cities of Sicily took refuge on
the summits of the hills, abandoning their low-lying suburbs to decay, and
allowing them finally to disappear. Girgenti is a case in point. Some of the
towns occupy sites of much natural strength, and are almost inaccessible. Such
are Centuripe, or Centorbi, which stretches along the edge of a rock to the west of
the Simeto, and San Giuliano, the town of Astarte, which stands on the summit of
a pyramidal rock 1,200 feet in height above Trapani. But, on the return of
peace, the inhabitants abandoned their eyries and came back to the plain or coast.
All along the northern coast, from Palermo to Messina, the towns on the <i>marina</i>,
or beach, kept increasing at the expense of the <i>borgos</i> occupying the summits of the
mountains, and in many instances the latter were deserted
altogether. Cefalù <span class="xxpn" id="p331">{331}</span>
affords a striking illustration of this change. The modern city nestles at the foot
of a bold promontory, upon the summit of which may still be seen the crenellated
walls of the old town, within which nothing now remains excepting a small
cyclopean temple, the most venerable ruin of all Sicily, which has resisted the
ravages of thirty centuries.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn112" id="fnanch112">112</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">The Æolian or Liparic Islands, though separated from Sicily by a strait more
than 300 fathoms in depth, may nevertheless be looked upon as a dependency of
the larger island. Some of these volcanic islands, “born in the shadow of Mount
Etna,” lie on a line connecting that volcano with Mount Vesuvius, and they
originated probably during the same convulsion of nature. They all consist of
lavas, cinders, or pumice, ejected from volcanoes. Two amongst them, Vulcano and
Stromboli, are still active volcanoes, and the flames and undulating columns of
smoke rising from them enable mariners and fishermen to foretell changes of
temperature or wind. It is probable that this intelligent interpretation of volcanic
phenomena was the reason why these islands were dedicated to Æolus, the god of
the winds, who there revealed himself to mariners.</p>

<p>Lipari, the largest and most central of these islands, is at the same time the
most populous. A considerable town, commanded by an ancient castle, rises like
an amphitheatre on its northern shore. A well-cultivated plain, abounding in
olive-trees, orange-trees, and vines, surrounds the town, and the slopes of the hills
are cultivated almost to their very summits. The population, as in Sicily, has
been recruited from the most diverse elements since the time that Greek colonists
from Rhodes, Cnidus, and Selinus entered into an alliance with the aboriginal inhabitants.
This intermixture of races is proceeding now as much as ever, for commerce
continually introduces fresh blood, and many Calabrian brigands have been conveyed
to the island, where they have become peaceable citizens. The population
is now permitted to multiply in peace, for the volcanoes of Lipari have been
quiescent for centuries. The Lipariotes have a legend according to which St.
Calogero chased the devils from the islands, and shut them up in the furnaces of
Vulcano, and we may infer from this that the last volcanic eruption took place soon
after the introduction of Christianity; that is to say, about the sixth century. The
existence of subterranean forces manifests itself now only
in thermal springs and <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
steam jets, which have been visited from the most ancient times for the cure of
diseases. Earthquakes, however, are of frequent occurrence, and that of 1780 so
much frightened the inhabitants that with one accord they dedicated themselves to
the Virgin Mary. Dolomieu, who visited Lipari in the year following, found them
wearing a small chain on the arm, by means of which they desired to show that
they had become the slaves of the “Liberating Virgin.”</p>

<p>Lipari is a land of promise to the geologist, on account of the great variety of
its lavas. Monte della Castagna is wholly composed of obsidian. Another hill, Monte
Bianco, consists of pumice, and, when seen from a distance, has the appearance of
being covered with snow. The streams of pumice which fill every ravine extend
down to the sea, and the water is covered with this buoyant stone, which drifts
sometimes as far as Corsica. Lipari supplies nearly the whole of Europe with
pumice.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn113" id="fnanch113">113</a></p>

<p>Vulcano, to the south of Lipari, from which it is separated by a strait less than
a mile across, contrasts strangely with its smiling neighbour. Vulcano, with the
exception of a few olives and vines growing on the southern slopes, consists wholly
of naked scoriæ, and this circumstance probably led to its being dedicated to
Vulcan. Most of its rocks are black or of a reddish hue
like iron, but there are <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
others which are scarlet, yellow, or white. At the northern extremity of the
island rises the Vulcanello, a small cone which appeared above the surface of the
sea nobody knows when, and which an isthmus of reddish cinders united about the
middle of the thirteenth century to the principal volcano of the island. This
central mountain of the island has a crater about 1,800 yards in circumference,
from which steam continually escapes. The atmosphere is charged with sulphurous
vapours difficult to breathe. From hundreds of small orifices jets of
steam make their escape with a throbbing and hissing noise. Some of these
fumaroles have a temperature of 610° F. Jets of a lower temperature are
met with in other parts of the island, and even at the bottom of the bay. Violent
eruptions are rare, and in the eighteenth century only three occurred. The last
eruption took place in 1873, after a repose of a hundred years. Until recently the
only inhabitants of Vulcano were a few convicts, who collected sulphur and
boracic acid, and manufactured a little alum. But an enterprising Scotchman has
now taken possession of this grand chemical laboratory. He has built a large
manufactory near the port, and a few trees planted around his Moorish residence
have somewhat improved the repulsive aspect of the country.</p>

<p>Stromboli, though smaller than either Lipari or Vulcano, is nevertheless
more celebrated, on account of its frequent eruptions. For ages back scarcely
any mariners have passed this island without seeing its summit in a state of
illumination. At intervals of five minutes, or less, the seething lava filling its
caldron bubbles up, explosions occur, and steam and stones are ejected. These
rhythmical eruptions form a most agreeable sight, for there is no danger about
them, and the olive groves of the Stromboliotes have never been injured by a
stream of lava. The volcano, however, has its moments of exasperation, and
its ashes have frequently been carried to the coast of Calabria, which is more
than thirty miles off.</p>

<p>Panaria and the surrounding group of islands between Stromboli and Lipari
have undergone many changes, if Dolomieu and Spallanzani are correct in
saying that they originally formed only a single island, which was blown into
fragments by an eruption having its centre near the present island of Dattilo.
A hot spring and an occasional bubbling up of the sea-water prove that the
volcanic forces are not yet quite extinct.</p>

<p>As regards the small eastern islands of the archipelago, Salina, Felicudi, and
Alicudi, the last of which resembles a tent pitched upon the surface of the
water, history furnishes no records of their ever having been in any other than a
quiescent state. The island of Ustica, about thirty miles to the north of Palermo,
is likewise of volcanic origin, but is not known ever to have had an eruption. It
is one of the most dreaded places of exile in Italy. Near it is the uninhabited
island of Medico, the ancient Osteodes, where the mercenaries deserted by the
Carthaginians were left to
die of starvation. <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">Off the western extremity of Sicily lie shallows, sand-banks, and calcareous
islands of the same composition as the adjoining mainland. These are the Ægades,
or Goat Islands, named after the animals which climb their steep escarpments.
Favignana, near which the Romans won the naval victory which terminated the
first Punic war, is the largest of these islands. Its steep cliffs abound in caverns,
in which heaps of shells, gnawed bones, and stone implements have been found,
dating back to the contemporaries of the mammoth and the antediluvian bear.
Conflicts between contrary winds are frequent in this labyrinth of rocks and
shoals, and the power of the waves is much dreaded. The tides are most irregular,
and give rise to dangerous eddies. The sudden ebb, locally known as <i>marubia</i>, or
“tipsy sea” (<i>mare ubbriaco?</i>), has been the cause of many shipwrecks.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Pantellaria
rises in the very centre of the strait which unites the Western
Me­di­ter­ra­nean with the Eastern. The island is of volcanic origin, abounds in
thermal springs, and, above all, in steam jets. Placed on a great line of navigation,
Pantellaria might have become of importance if it had possessed a good harbour
like Malta. To judge from certain ruins, the population
was more considerable <span class="xxpn" id="p335">{335}</span>
formerly than it is now. There exist about a thousand odd edifices, called <i>sesi</i> by
the inhabitants, which are supposed to be ancient dwellings. Like the <i>nuraghi</i> of
Sardinia, they have the shape of hives, and are built of huge blocks of rock
without mortar. Some of them are twenty-five feet high and forty-five feet wide;
and Rossi, the archæologist, thinks that they date back to the stone age, for pieces
of worked obsidian have been found in them.</p>

<p>From the top of Pantellaria we are able to distinguish the promontories on
the Tunisian coast, but, though it is nearer to Africa than to Europe, the island
nevertheless belongs to the latter continent, as is proved by the configuration of
the sea-bottom. This cannot be said of Linosa, an island with four volcanic peaks
to the west of Malta, and still less of the Pelagian Islands. The latter, consisting
of Lampedusa and a satellite rock called Lampion, owe their name (Lamp-bearer
and Lamp) to the light which, legend tells us, was kept burning by a hermit or
angel for the benefit of mariners. In our own days this legendary lamp has been
superseded by a small lighthouse marking the entrance to the port of Lampedusa,
where vessels of three or four hundred tons find a safe shelter.</p>

<p>About the close of the eighteenth century the Russians proposed to establish
a military station on Lampedusa to rival that of Malta, but this project was never
carried out, and has not been taken up by the Italian Government. The population
consists of soldiers, political exiles, criminals, and a few settlers, who speak
Maltese.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn114" id="fnanch114">114</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">Malta,
though a political dependency of Great Britain, belongs geographically to
Italy, for it rises from the same submarine plateau as Sicily. About fifty miles to
the east of the island the depth of the sea exceeds 1,500 fathoms, but in the north,
in the direction of Sicily, it hardly amounts to eighty, and there can be no doubt
that an isthmus formerly united Malta to continental Europe. Geologists are agreed
that the land of which Malta and Gozzo are now the only remains must formerly
have been of great extent, for amongst the fossils of its most recent limestone
rocks have been found the bones of elephants and other animals which only
inhabit continents. Even now the island is slowly wasting away, and its steep
cliffs, pierced by numerous grottoes, locally known as <i>ghar</i>, are gradually crumbling
into dust.</p>

<p>Placed in the very centre of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and possessed of an excellent
port, Malta has at all times been a commercial station of much importance. It
has been occupied by all the nations who succeeded each other in the possession
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean—Phœnicians, Carthaginians, Romans, and Greeks. But long
before that time the island must have been inhabited, for we meet with grottoes
excavated in the rocks, and with curious edifices resembling the <i>nuraghi</i> of
Sardinia, and it is just possible that the descendants
of these aborigines still <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
constitute the principal element of the existing population, which, at all events,
is very mixed, and during the domination of the Saracens almost became Arab.
The language spoken is a very corrupt Italian, containing many Arabic words.</p>

</div><!--dctr-->

<p>The great military part played by Malta began when the Knights of St. John,
after their expulsion from Rhodes in 1522, installed themselves upon the island,
and converted it into the bulwark of the Christian world. In the beginning of this
century Malta passed into the possession of the English, who may survey thence,
as from a watch-tower, the whole of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
from Gibraltar to Smyrna <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
and Port Said. The excellent port of La Valetta singularly facilitates the military
and commercial part which Malta is called upon to play in the world of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean. It is sufficiently spacious to shelter two entire fleets, and its
approaches are defended by fortifications rendered impregnable by the successive
work of three centuries. There are, besides, all the facilities required by merchantmen,
including a careening dock larger than any other in the world. The
commerce of the island is rapidly increasing; it is one of the great centres of
steamboat navigation, and submarine telegraphs connect it with all parts of the
world.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn115" id="fnanch115">115</a></p>

<p>The city of La Valetta has retained all its ancient picturesqueness, in spite
of its straight streets and the walls which surround it. Its high white houses,
ornamented with balconies and conservatories, rise amphitheatre-like on the slope
of a hill; stairs lead from landing-place to landing-place to the summit of this
hill; and from every street we behold the blue sea, with its large merchantmen and
crowds of smaller vessels. Gondolas, having two huge eyes painted upon the prow,
glide noiselessly over the waters, and curious vehicles roll heavily along the
quays. Maltese, English soldiers, and sailors of every nation crowd the streets.
Now and then a woman glides rapidly along the walls. Like all Christian women
of the East, she wears the <i>faldetta</i>, a sort of black silk domino, which hides her
sumptuous dress, and coquettishly conceals her features.</p>

<p>Malta beyond the walls of the town is but a dreary place of abode. The
country rises gently towards the south, in the direction of Città Vecchia and the
hills of Ben Gemma. Grey rocks abound, a fine dust covers the vegetation, and
the white walls of the village glisten in the sun. There are no trees, except in a
few solitary gardens, where the famous mandarin oranges grow. Nor are there
any rivers. The soil is scorched, and it is matter for astonishment that it should
yield such abundant harvests of cereals, and clover (<i>sulla</i>) growing to the height
of a man. Carnation tints delight the eye during the season of flowers. The
Maltese peasants, small, wiry, and muscular, are wonderfully industrious. They
have brought the whole island under cultivation, the cliffs alone excepted, and,
where vegetable soil is wanting, they produce it artificially by triturating the rocks.
In former times vessels coming from Sicily were bound to bring a certain quantity
of soil as ballast. But in spite of their careful cultivation, the inhabitants of
Malta, Gozzo, and Comino (thus named from cumin, which, with cotton, is the
principal crop of the island), the produce hardly suffices for six months’ consumption,
and the islanders are largely dependent upon Sicily for their food. Navigation
and the fisheries contribute likewise towards the means of subsistence, but
the Maltese would nevertheless perish on their island if the surplus population
did not emigrate to all the coast lands of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and especially to
Algeria, where the Maltese, as everywhere else, are distinguished for thrift and
industry. <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span></p>

<p>In winter this exodus is in some measure compensated for by the arrival of
many English families, who visit the island for the sake of its dry and mild
climate. February is the finest month, and the island is then resplendent with
verdure, but the scorching heat of summer soon dries up the vegetation.</p>

<p>A governor appointed by the Crown exercises executive functions, and enjoys
the privilege of mercy. He is assisted by a Council of seven members, by whom
all laws are discussed and voted. The lord-lieutenant of each district is chosen
amongst the Maltese nobles, and deputies appointed by the governor manage
the affairs of the villages. Italian is the language used in the courts, with the
exception of the Supreme Court, into which English was introduced in 1823.</p>

<p>The revenues of the island, about £170,000 annually, are not sufficient to cover
the military expenses, and the deficiency is made up by the imperial treasury.</p>

<p>Most of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics. The bishop is appointed by the
Pope, and enjoys an income of £4,000.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn116" id="fnanch116">116</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 title="VIII.—Sardinia.">VIII.—<span

<p class="pfirst">It is a curious fact that an island so fertile as Sardinia, so rich in metals, and so
favourably situated in the centre of the Tyrrhenian Sea, should have lagged
behind in the race of progress as it has. When the Carthaginians held that
island its population was certainly more numerous than it is now, and the fearful
massacres placed on record by the historians of Rome testify to this fact. Its
decadence was sudden and thorough. In part it may be accounted for by the
configuration of the island, which presents steep cliffs towards Italy, whence
emigrants might have arrived, whilst its western coast is bounded by marshes
and insalubrious swamps. But the principal cause of this torpor, which endured
for centuries, is traceable to the actions of man. The conquerors who succeeded
the Romans and Byzantines in the possession of the island, whether Saracens,
Pisans, Genoese, or Aragonese, monopolized its produce solely with a view to
their own profit, and further mischief was wrought by the pirates of Barbary, who
frequently descended upon its coasts. As recently as 1815 the Tunisians landed
upon Sant’ Antioco, massacring the inhabitants, or carrying them into slavery.
The coast districts became depopulated, and the inhabitants retired to the interior,
where, oppressed by their feudal lords, they led a life of isolation from the rest of
Europe. It is hardly a generation since Sardinia began to participate in the
general progress made throughout Italy.</p>

<p>Sardinia is nearly as large as Sicily, but has only a fourth of its population.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn117" id="fnanch117">117</a>
Geographically it is more independent of Italy than the southern island, and a
profound sea, more than 1,000 fathoms in depth, divides it from the African
continent. Sardinia with Corsica forms a group of twin islands, which is separated
from the Tuscan archipelago by a narrow strait
only 170 fathoms in depth. <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span>
The geological structure of the two islands is identical, and there can be no doubt
that the islands and rocks in the Strait of Bonifacio are the remains of an isthmus
destroyed by the sea. On the other hand, we learn from a study of the geology of
Sardinia that at a period not very remote that island must have consisted of
several separate islands. The principal island formed
a southerly continuation <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span>
of the mountains of Corsica, whilst the smaller ones lay to the west. Alluvial
deposits, volcanic eruptions, and perhaps, also, an upheaval of the soil, have
converted the shallow straits which separated them into dry land.</p>

<p>The mountains of Sardinia may be said to begin with the islands of Maddalena
and Caprera, in the Strait of Bonifacio, and in the mountain mass of the Gallura
they attain already a considerable height. A depression separates these from the
southern portion of the great back-bone of the island, which stretches along the
whole of the eastern coast, and terminates abruptly at Cape Carbonaro. These
mountains, like those of Corsica, consist of crystalline rocks and schists; but
whilst the slope on the latter island is steepest towards the west, the reverse is the
case on Sardinia, and that island may almost be said to turn its back upon Italy.
The general slope of the island is towards the west, and its occupation by Spain
could therefore be justified by purely geographical arguments.</p>

<p>The highest summits of the island are found in the central portion of this
crystalline chain, where the Gennargentu, or “silver mountain,” rises to a height of
6,116 feet. A little snow remains in the crevices of this mountain throughout the
summer. The inhabitants of Northern Sardinia formerly imagined that their own
Gigantinu, or “giant,” in the mountains of Limbarra, constituted the culminating
point of the island, but careful measurements have shown that that superb peak
only attains an elevation of 4,297 feet.</p>

<p>The secondary mountain groups in the western portion of the island are
separated from the main chain by recent geological
formations. The granitic <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
region of La Nurra, to the west of Sassari, almost uninhabited in spite of its
fertile valleys, and the island of Asinara adjoining it, which abounds in turtles,
are amongst these insulated mountain regions. Another, intersected by the
beautiful valley of Domus Novas, occupies the south-western extremity of the
island. Geologists look upon it as the most ancient portion of the island, and
the plain of Campidano, which now occupies the site of an ancient arm of the sea,
is of quaternary formation. The transversal range of Marghine occupies the
centre of the island, and there, too, we meet with vast limestone plateaux pierced
by volcanic rocks. The ancient craters, however, no longer emit lava, nor even
gases, and the villagers have tranquilly built their huts within them. Thermal
springs alone indicate the existence of subterranean forces. Volcanic cones of
recent age are met with in the north-western portion of the island, as well as in
the valley of the Orosei, on the east coast. The trachytic rocks of the islands of
San Pietro and Sant’ Antioco are of greater age. They sometimes present the
appearance of architectural piles, especially at the Cape of Columns, which is,
however, rapidly disappearing, as the stone is being quarried to be converted into
pavement. On Sant’ Antioco, which a bridge joins to the mainland, there are
deep caverns, the haunts of thousands of pigeons, which are caught by spreading
a net before their entrance.</p>

<p>In addition to the changes wrought by volcanic agencies, Sardinia exhibits
traces of a slow upheaval or subsidence due to the expansion or contraction of the
upper strata of the earth. Raised beaches have been discovered by La Marmora
near Cagliari, at an elevation of 243 and 322 feet above the sea-level, where
shells of living species are found together with potsherds and other articles,
proving that when this upheaval took place the island was already inhabited.
Elsewhere there exist traces of a subsidence, and the old Phœnician cities of Nora,
to the south-west of Cagliari, and Tharros, on the northern peninsula of the
Gulf of Oristano, have become partly submerged.</p>

<p>Amongst the rivers of the island there is only one which deserves that
name. This is the Tirso, or Fiume d’Oristano, which is fed by the snows of the
Gennargentu and the rains which descend on the western mountain slopes. Other
rivers of equal length are hardly more than torrents, which at one time invade the
fields adjoining them, and at another shrink to a thin thread of water meandering
between thickets of laurel-trees. Most of the river beds are dry during eight
months of the year, and even after rain the water does not find its way into the
sea, but is absorbed by the littoral swamps.</p>

<p>All these swamps have brackish water. The largest amongst them communicate
freely with the sea, at least during the rainy season, but others are separated from
it by a strip of sand. But these, too, are brackish, for the sea-water percolates
through the soil, and keeps them at the same level. The water of the inland
swamps is likewise saturated with saline substances derived from the surrounding
soil. They generally dry up in summer, but the coating of salt which then appears
is hardly dry enough to repay the labour of collection and refinement. The only
salt marshes actually exploited are those of Cagliari and of
Carlo-Forte, on San <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
Pietro. They have been leased to a French company, and yield annually nearly
120,000 tons of salt.</p>

<p>Swamps and marshes envelop nearly the whole of the island in a zone of miasmata,
which are carried by the wind into the interior, producing fever even in the
more elevated mountain districts. There are localities on the island the air of
which no stranger can breathe with impunity. The coast districts of Sardinia,
with their stagnant waters, are, in truth, the most unhealthy in Italy, and quite
one-fourth of the area of the island is exposed to the scourge of malaria, which
sufficiently accounts for the small population of the island and the little progress
made.</p>

<p>Even when Sardinia was at the height of its prosperity, and supplied Rome
with an abundance of corn, cheese, pork, lead, copper, iron, and textile fabrics,
it was noted for its unhealthiness, and the emperors exiled to it those whom they
desired to get rid of. Then, as now, the landed proprietors, about the middle of
June, retired to the towns, the walls of which offered some protection against the
poisonous air. The Italian Government officials are sent to the island as a punishment,
and for the most part look upon themselves as condemned to death. Even
the native villagers are bound to observe the greatest precautions, and wear garments
of skin or leather which are impenetrable to rain, mist, and dew. They
are dressed most warmly during the hottest part of the year as a protection against
the climate, and in their long <i>mastrucas</i> of sheepskin they almost look like Wallachian
herdsmen.</p>

<p>Ancient geographers, as well as the Sardinians themselves, ascribe the unhealthiness
of the climate to the rarity of north-easterly winds. The mountains of Limbarra,
in the north of the island, are popularly supposed to act as a sort of screen,
which diverts this health-bringing wind, to the great detriment of Lower Sardinia;
and there appears to be much truth in this popular notion. South-westerly
winds, or <i>libeccios</i>, are almost equally rare, and when they blow they do so with
tempestuous violence.</p>

<p>The regular winds of Sardinia blow from the north-west or south-east. The
former is known as the <i>maestrale</i>, the latter as the <i>levante</i> or <i>sirocco</i>, called <i>maledetto
levante</i> by the inhabitants of Southern Sardinia. It becomes charged with moisture
during its passage across the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and its temperature is in reality much
less than might be supposed from the lassitude produced by it. The maestrale, on
the other hand, is hailed with joy, for it is an invigorating wind. On reaching the
coast it generally parts with its moisture, and when it arrives at Cagliari it is perfectly
dry. The capital of Sardinia is indebted to this wind and to sea breezes
for its low temperature (62·4° F.), which is far lower than that of Genoa.</p>

<p>Hurricanes are comparatively rare, and hailstorms, which work such damage
elsewhere, are hardly known. Most of the rain falls in autumn; it ceases in
December, when the pleasantest season sets in. These are the “halcyon days”
of ancient poets, when the sea calms down in order that the sacred bird may build
his nest. But these pleasant days are succeeded by a wretched spring. February,
the “double-faced month” of Sardinian mariners, brings capricious
frosts, to which <span class="xxpn" id="p343">{343}</span>
succeed, in March and April, abrupt changes of temperature, winds, and rain.
Vegetation in consequence is far more backward than might be supposed from the
latitude.</p>

<p>The vegetation of Sardinia resembles that of the other islands of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.
The forest in the highland valleys of the interior and on the trackless
mountain slopes consists of pines, oaks, and holm-oaks, mixed here and there with
yoke-elms and maples. The villages are surrounded by chestnut-trees and groves
of magnificent walnut-trees. The hill-tops, robbed of their forests, are covered
with odoriferous plants and thickets of myrtles, strawberry-trees, and heather. It
is there the bees collect the bitter honey so much despised by Horace. Vast tracts of
uncultivated land near the seashore are covered with wild olive-trees, which only
need grafting to yield excellent fruit. All the fruit trees and useful plants of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean flourish in Sardinia. Almond and orange trees, introduced by
the Moors at the close of the eleventh century, flourish vigorously. The orange
groves of Millis, which are protected by the extinct volcano of Monte Ferru, are,
perhaps, the most productive on the shores of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and in good
seasons yield 60,000,000 oranges. The gardens of Domus Novas, Ozieri, and
Sassari are of surprising fertility. In the southern part of the island, wherever the
cultivated fields gain upon the lands covered with rock-roses, fennel, and lilies,
they are fenced in with fig-trees. The fan-shaped foliage of the date-palm is seen
near every town, and more especially in the environs of Cagliari. By a curious
contrast the dwarf palm is not met with in the southern lowlands of the island,
though their climate is almost African, but forms dense thickets in the solitudes of
Alghero, in the north of the islands. The inhabitants eat the roots of this tree, as
do also the Moors.</p>

<p>Although all the plants of neighbouring countries become easily acclimatized in
Sardinia, that island is naturally poorer in species than are continental regions
lying under the same latitude. There is nothing special about its flora, for the
island is probably only a remnant of a larger tract of land which formerly joined
Europe to Africa. As to the famous plant mentioned by ancient writers, which, eaten
by mistake, produced fits of “sardonic laughter,” or even death, it does not
appear to be peculiar to the island. Mimaut thinks, from the descriptions of
Pliny and Pausanias, that the large-leafed water-parsley (<i>Sium latifolium</i>) is
referred to.</p>

<p>The number of species of animals, like that of plants, is smaller in Sardinia
than on the neighbouring continent. There are neither bears, badgers, polecats,
nor moles. Vipers or venomous serpents of any description do not exist, and the
only animal to be dreaded is the tarentula (<i>arza</i>, or <i>argia</i>),
a sting from which
can be cured only by dancing until completely exhausted, or by immersion in
dung. The ordinary frog, though common in Corsica, does not exist, but European
butterflies are numerous. The <i>moufflon</i>, which is, perhaps, the ancestor of our
domestic sheep, and has been exterminated in nearly all the islands of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean, still lives in the mountains of Corsica and Sardinia. Wild horses
roamed over Sant’ Antioco as recently as the beginning of
this century; myriads <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
of rabbits burrow in the small islands lining the coast; and wild goats with long
horns and yellow teeth inhabit the limestone island of Tavolara, in the Gulf of
Terranova. These goats are descended from domestic animals abandoned at some
former period. Caprera, the residence of Garibaldi, is named after the goats
which formerly inhabited it, and animals of that kind recently introduced there
quickly returned to a state of nature.</p>

<p>Naturalists have observed that the mammals of Sardinia are smaller than the
same species living on the continent. The goat is the only exception to the rule.
The stag, deer, wild boar, fox, wild cat, hare, rabbit, marten, and weasel are all of
them smaller than the continental varieties. The same rule applies to domesticated
animals, with the exception of the pig, which grows to a great size, especially where
it is allowed to roam through oak forests. There is a variety of this animal
whose hoofs are not cloven, and which ought, therefore, to be classed amongst solipeds.
The horses and asses of Sardinia are dwarfs. But the horse is distinguished
by great sobriety, sureness of foot, vigour, and endurance. If in addition to these
advantages it possessed a more attractive exterior, it would rank among the most
highly appreciated horses of Europe. As to the donkeys, though hardly larger
than a mastiff, they are brave little animals, and frequently share with their
masters the only room of their abode. The old-fashioned mills, resembling in
every respect the Roman bas-reliefs which may be seen in the Vatican, are
propelled by these donkeys, which thus materially contribute towards the support
of their proprietors.</p>

<p>Sardinia abounds more than any other country of Western Europe in prehistoric
remains. There are megaliths, known as “giants’ stones,” “altars,” or
“long-stones,” as in Brittany, scarcely any of them showing traces of the chisel.
Dolmens, however, are rare, and the genuineness of all is doubted. Amongst
these monuments there are, perhaps, some which were connected with the worship
of some Eastern deity, for Phœnicians and Carthaginians stayed for a considerable
time upon the island, where they founded Caralis, Nora, Tharros, and other towns;
and even during the time of the Romans it was customary to place Punic inscriptions
upon the tombstones. The ruins of Tharros have yielded golden idols and
other articles in large numbers, most of them being of Egyptian origin. But the
principal witnesses to the civilisation of the ancient Sards are the curious
structures known as <i>nuraghi</i>. They generally occupy the hill-tops, and, seen from
a distance, resemble pyramids. The limestone plateau of Giara, near the centre of
the island, is surrounded by masonry structures of this description, which abound
also in other portions of the island, the number still existing being nearly 4,000.
They are most numerous in the basaltic region to the south of Macomer,
and are met with for the most part in fertile districts, far away from the arid
steppes.</p>

<p>The origin and uses of these nuraghi have been a subject of much discussion, but
archæologists now almost universally adopt the views of Signor Spano, the indefatigable
explorer of Sardinian antiquities. According to him these nuraghi were
dwellings, and their Phœnician name simply means “round
house.” The rudest <span class="xxpn" id="p345">{345}</span>
among them, dating back probably for forty centuries, contain but a single chamber.
They were erected during the age of stone, when man first gave up his cavern
dwellings. The more recent constructions date back to the age of bronze, and even
of iron. More skill is exhibited in their structure, though no mortar has been
used, and they contain two or more chambers, forming as many floors, and accessible
by means of stone stairs. The ground floor of some is large enough for the accommodation
of forty or fifty persons, and is furnished with antechambers and small
semicircular recesses. The nuraghi of Su Domu or S’Orcu, near Domus Novas,
which has recently been demolished, contained ten chambers and four courtyards;
it was a fortress as well as a dwelling-place, capable of accommodating a hundred
persons and standing a siege. The dwellings of the modern Albanians and of the
Swaneti in the Caucasus still resemble these ancient abodes.</p>

</div><!--dctr-->

<p>The rubbish which accumulated in these nuraghi has yielded a multitude of
objects which throw light upon the daily life of the inhabitants, and bear witness to
their relative civilisation. The lower strata only contain hand-made utensils, stone
arms, and pottery, but in the upper and more recent layers many articles of bronze
have been found. Other monuments of cyclopean structure stand near these
ancient dwellings. They are popularly known as “giants’
tombs,” and Signor <span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span>
Sapi, who has examined a large number of them, has discovered in every instance
the ashes of human beings.</p>

<p>Though very superstitious, the Sardinians have no legends respecting these
dwellings of the aborigines, and at most attribute them to the devil. This
absence of traditions is no doubt traceable to the almost total annihilation of
the inhabitants by successive conquerors. The Carthaginians showed no mercy
to the aborigines, and during the first centuries of Roman rule massacres and
forcible emigration were the order of the day, and the gaps thus created were filled
up by Italian colonists and exiles.</p>

<p>The ancient Sards were most likely Iberians. They are of low stature, and
the climate, which has stunted the growth of wild and domesticated animals,
appears to have influenced man likewise; but they are well proportioned and
muscular, have an abundance of black hair and strong beards, and scarcely ever
grow bald. There are minor differences in the Sards of the two provinces. Those
of the north have generally oval features and an aquiline nose, whilst those near
Cagliari, who are probably more mixed, have irregular features and prominent
cheek-bones.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the interior of the island are, perhaps, of purer race than any
other Europeans. Their ancestors, no doubt, were of the most diverse origin, but
most invasions which took place after the Roman era stopped short at the coast.
The Vandals paid a visit to Sardinia, but all the other Germanic tribes, who
ravaged nearly every other country of Western Europe, spared that island, and
its inhabitants were thus able to preserve their manners and language. The
Moors, Pisans, Genoese, Catalonians, and Spaniards, who successively invaded the
island, never penetrated beyond the coast. There is only one exception to this
rule, viz. that of the Barbaricini, who inhabit the mountain district of Barbagia,
in the very centre of the island, and who are supposed to be the descendants of
Berbers expelled from Africa by the Vandals. When they came to the island
they were still pagans, and they intermarried with their neighbours, the Ilienses,
an aboriginal tribe, pagans like themselves. They were converted to Christianity
in the seventh century, and the sombre dress worn by their women reminds us of
Barbary.</p>

<p>Of all the idioms derived from the Latin, that spoken in Sardinia has most
resemblance to the language of the ancient Romans. More than five hundred
words are absolutely identical. There are likewise a few Greek words not met
with in any other Latin idiom, as well as two or three words which have no
affinity with any other European tongue, and which are, perhaps, derived from the
language spoken by the aborigines. The two leading dialects, those of Logoduro,
in the north, and of Cagliari, are directly derived from the Latin, and are, perhaps,
most nearly related to Spanish. At Sassari, and in some of the neighbouring coast
districts, an Italian dialect is spoken which is very much like that of Corsica or
Genoa. At Alghero the descendants of the Catalonian immigrants who settled
there about the middle of the fourteenth century still speak their old Provençal.
The <i>Maurelli</i>, or <i>Maureddus</i>, in the environs of Iglesias, who
are probably Berbers, <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
and can be recognised by their narrow skulls, make use of a few African words.
Maltzan looks upon the inhabitants of the fertile district of Millis as the purest
representatives of African immigrants, and it was they who introduced the cultivation
of the orange into Sardinia.</p>

<p>The Sardinians of the interior not only retain their ancient language, but likewise
many of their ancient customs. Their dances are still the same as in the
time of Greece. In the north the steps are regulated by the human voice, the
chanters occupying the centre of the ring. In the south a musical instrument,
the <i>launedda</i>, is used, which is nothing but an ancient flute, made of two or three
reeds. The customs observed at christenings, weddings, and funerals are likewise
of remote date. Marriage, as amongst nearly all the ancient inhabitants of
Europe, is preceded by a feigned abduction of the bride. The latter, after she has
entered the house of her husband, must not stir from her place during that day,
nor speak a single word. Mute as a statue, she is no longer a sentient being,
but a “thing,” the property of her husband. She is not permitted to see her
relatives during three days, and in the south many women partly conceal their
features.</p>

<p>The mountaineers likewise observe the lugubrious ceremony of a wake, called
<i>titio</i> or <i>attito</i>. Women, who are either the friends of the deceased or are engaged
for the purpose, penetrate the mortuary chamber, tear their hair, howl, and
improvise hymns of mourning. These old pagan ceremonies become truly terrific
when the deceased has been the victim of assassination, for in that case the
mourners swear to take the life of the murderer. Up to the beginning of this
century the practice of the vendetta annually cost the lives of hundreds of young
men. At the present day it is confined to the most secluded parts of the island,
and in the mountain districts of Nuoro and La Gallura it is customary at
christenings to place a few bullets in the swaddling-clothes of the infants,
these consecrated bullets being supposed never to miss their mark. Another
custom still more barbarous has ceased to be observed since the beginning of
the last century. Women, called “finishers” (<i>accabadure</i>), were employed to
hasten the end of dying persons, a practice which often led to the most atrocious
deeds.</p>

<p>The peasant of Sardinia, though not the proprietor of the soil, is nevertheless
permitted to enjoy the result of his labour. The feudal system existed up to 1840,
and many traces of it still survive. The great barons, most of them of Spanish
extraction, were almost the absolute masters of the country, and up to 1836 they
administered the law, had their prisons, and erected gallows as a symbol of their
power. The peasants, however, were not tied to the land, but could migrate at
pleasure, and custom granted them a fair share of the produce of the soil. By
virtue of an <i>ademprivio</i> they were permitted to cut wood in the forests, to pasture
their sheep on the hills, and to bring into cultivation the waste lands of the plains.
Agriculture was carried on in the most primitive fashion, for the great lords of
the land usually resided abroad, and the management of their estates was left to
bailiffs. Government has now become the proprietor of most
of the unenclosed <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
land, 80,000 acres of which have been ceded to the Anglo-Italian Company, which
has undertaken to provide the island with a network of railways.</p>

<p>In the more densely populated districts the division of the land is exceedingly
minute, and this subdivision is still progressing at a most disastrous rate. The
nomad herdsmen, on the other hand, possess no land of their own, though, if
inclined, they are at liberty to enclose a plot. But vague proprietary rights like
these render the careful cultivation of the soil impossible. It has been seriously
proposed to expropriate the whole of the land, and to sell it to a few enterprising
capitalists, but this would simply amount to a restoration of the old feudal times,
and poverty, which is great even now, would become greater. There are villages in
the district of Ogliastra where the peasants eat bread made of the acorns of <i>Quercus
ilex</i>, the dough being kneaded with water containing a fatty clay. This is, perhaps,
the only instance of earth-eating in Europe. The Spaniards, too, eat acorn bread,
but they use the fruit of <i>Quercus ballota</i>, which is really edible, and are careful
not to mix its flour with earth.</p>

<p>The Sardinians, even when they are the owners of pasture-grounds or of fields,
never live in the country. Like the Sicilians, they are concentrated in towns or
large villages, and neither hamlets nor isolated farmhouses are
met with. Even <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span>
the shepherds in the mountains build their huts in groups called <i>stazzi</i>, and
combine for mutual protection into <i>cussorgie</i>. Members of these associations, when
they lose their cattle from disease or any other cause, may claim one or more
beasts from every one of their comrades living within the same district or canton.
In other parts of the island—as, for instance, near Iglesias—the produce of the
orchards is looked upon as common property. The mountaineers, though poor,
practise the ancient virtue of hospitality, and though the dwellings are rude, they
find means of making a stranger staying amongst them comfortable.</p>

<p>The products of Sardinia form but a small proportion of those of all Italy.
Most of the peasants only work by fits and starts, and hardly more than a fourth
of the area of the island has been brought under cultivation. It sometimes
happens that the crops are destroyed by the scorching heat of the sun, or eaten up
by locusts, which come in swarms from Africa. Except near Sassari no attempt is
made to improve the produce. The olive-tree alone is cultivated with some care,
for the grower of a certain number of these trees may claim political privileges,
and even the title of “Count,” and thousands of proprietors have converted their
sterile steppes into productive olive groves. The millions of oranges grown in the
gardens of Millis and elsewhere are taken entirely for home consumption.
Commercially these oranges are of less importance than the saline plants collected
in the marshes of the coast districts, and the ashes of which are exported to
Marseilles to be converted into soda.</p>

<p>The working of granite and marble quarries yields some profit, but the mines,
which were of such importance in the time of the Romans, are hardly touched
now. There is only one iron mine, that of San Leone, where work has been carried
on seriously by a French company since 1822. It yields about 50,000 tons of ore
annually, and the oldest railway of the island connects that mine with Cagliari. The
district of Iglesias, where the Romans founded Plumbea and Metalla, and the
Pisans searched for silver, has recently regained some of its ancient importance on
account of its lead and zinc mines. The waste of the old mines is likewise being
scientifically treated by French, English, and Italian companies, to whom mining
claims have been ceded, and a curious stalactite cavern which traverses the hill
near Domus Novas has been utilised in gaining access to the scoriæ. Iglesias is
rapidly growing into a city of modern aspect, the village of Gonessa is already a
respectable town, and the little harbour of Porto Scuso, until recently almost
deserted, is now crowded with small craft employed in carrying annually 900,000
tons of lead and zinc ore to the roadstead of Carlo-Forte. Unfortunately the
miners, especially those from abroad, frequently succumb to the climate.</p>

<p>The fisheries, being for the most part carried on in the bays exposed to the
sea breezes, are not attended by the same dangers. Certain portions of the coast
abound in fish, such as the Bay of Cagliari, and the narrow arms of the sea in the
archipelago of the Maddalena, which the ancients searched for purple shells.
Anchovies and “sardines” periodically visit the coasts, and as many as 50,000
tunny-fish are sometimes caught in a single season. The swamps or lagoons likewise
yield fish, which are caught in nets spread at the openings
of the channels <span class="xxpn" id="p350">{350}</span>
communicating with the sea. The swamp of Cagliari abounds in shad, that of
Oristano in mullets and eels, and that of Alghero in pike and gold fish. The fisheries
of Sardinia are consequently of much importance, but most of their profits are
reaped by strangers. Corsicans fish near La Maddalena, Genoese around San
Pietro, and Italians monopolize the coral fisheries. These latter, too, collect the
<i>Pinna nobilis</i>, a shell, the silky byssus of which is converted into stuff for garments.
Nor do the Sardinians take to the sea as sailors, and the commerce of the island
is carried on almost exclusively in Genoese and other Italian vessels. Out of
2,400 proverbs collected by Spano, only three refer to the sea&#x202f;!&#x202f;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn118" id="fnanch118">118</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the northern “Cape” of Sassari, or <i>di Sopra</i>, claim to be
more intelligent and civilised than those of the southern “Cape” of Cagliari, or
<i>di Sotto</i>. The former do not call themselves Sardinians at all, but apply that
name, which to them is synonymous with barbarians,
to the inhabitants of the <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span>
interior and of the south. In former times these two sections of the population
hated each other, and the spirit of the vendetta, which set family against family,
village against village, made its influence felt all over the island. This old
animosity has not yet completely died out; but the people of Sassari can no
longer claim to be the superiors of their southern neighbours. They certainly
are better agriculturists and more industrious, but the southerners possess the
richest mines, their portion of the island is most productive, and it is the seat of
the capital.</p>

<p>Cagliari, the ancient <i>Caralis</i>, has remained the great emporium of the island
since the days of Carthage. Only a few idols, sepulchral chambers, the ruins of
an aqueduct, and an amphitheatre excavated in the rock, recall the dominion of
Carthaginians and Romans, but it could not be deprived of its excellent harbour
and magnificent roadstead. The town was only a short time under the rule
of the Moors, but its physiognomy is almost more oriental than that of any city
in Europe, many of its houses being provided with cupolas and balconies overhanging
the streets. Its position as a place of commerce is most favourable, for
it lies on the ocean highway connecting Sicily with the Balearic Islands, and the
coast of Africa is within a day’s sail. It is sure to prosper, especially if a serious
effort is made to drain the marshes and to transform the plain of the Campidano
into a fertile garden. The latter, an ancient arm of the sea, extends to the
south-east towards Oristano, the “town of potters.” During
the Middle Ages <span class="xxpn" id="p352">{352}</span>
the latter was the seat of the most powerful lords of the island, and it was thence
Eleonora promulgated her famous <i>Carta de logu</i>, which became the public law of
the whole island. Oristano has an excellent harbour, sheltered by the peninsula
of Tharros, upon which the Phœnicians had founded one of their settlements; its
fields are fertile, and, to bring about a return of its ancient prosperity, it is only
necessary to drain the marshes which now hem it in. In former times fires were
lighted upon the walls of the town during the season of malaria, to purify the atmosphere;
but the vast forests from which the fuel for these fires was procured have
disappeared, and this portion of Sardinia is no longer entitled to its ancient
epithet of “Arborea.” It is said that in the marshes of Nurachi, to the north-east
of Oristano, may be heard now and then a noise resembling the bellowing
of a bull. This noise is probably produced by the passage of air through some
subterranean cavern, and similar phenomena have been observed on the coast of
Dalmatia.</p>

<p>Sassari the delightful, the rival of Cagliari, is embosomed amidst olive-trees,
gardens, and country houses. It alone, of all the towns of the island, could boast
of a republican government during the Middle Ages, and the public spirit of its
present inhabitants is, perhaps, traceable to this circumstance. Its geographical
position, however, is far less favourable than that of Cagliari, for a zone of
swamps separates it from the sea. It might export its produce through the port
of Alghero or the excellent harbour of Porto Conto, to the south of the
mountains of La Nurra; but facility of access has dictated its choice of Porto
Torres, a miserable village on the swampy shore of the Gulf of Asinara. Porto
Torres occupies the site of a Roman city, and the arches of a huge aqueduct and
the columns of a Temple of Fortune still rise above the reeds. This old port
certainly offers great facility for the export of the olive oil of Sassari and the
wines of Tempio, as respects France and Genoa; but the intricate navigation of
the Strait of Bonifacio separates it from the nearest Italian coast. Italy has
therefore determined to create an additional port on the east coast of the island,
and the Bay of Terranova has been selected for that purpose. <i>Olbia</i>, which at
the time of the Romans had no less than 150,000 inhabitants, occupied the site
of the present town, which the Italians fondly imagine may become the great
emporium of the island. Its port is certainly well sheltered, and the roadsteads
of the archipelago of La Maddalena near it afford additional accommodation; but
seriously to improve the condition of Sardinia it will be necessary, above all things,
to drain its dreary swamps, and to “transform their poisonous exhalations into
bread.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn119" id="fnanch119">119</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">No impartial spectator can deny that Italy, since it has again taken its place
among the nations of Europe, promises great things
for the future. Even its <span class="xxpn" id="p353">{353}</span>
political regeneration has brought to the surface men of the highest intellect,
courage, zeal, and public spirit. There are some amongst them whom posterity
will look upon as a credit to all mankind. Possibly this period of excitement
and nervous activity may be succeeded by a sort of moral collapse, such as
generally takes place after every great crisis in the life of a nation. But this
need not render us anxious for the future, for generations exhausted by the efforts
they have made will be succeeded by others eager to continue the work their predecessors
have begun.</p>

<p>In sciences and arts the native country of Volta, Cialdi, Secchi, Rossini, Verdi,
and Vela occupies even now a position of equality with the most advanced nations
of Europe. The Italian of the present day is able to refer without shame to the
two great centuries of the Renaissance, for he has entered upon a second period
of regeneration, and the names of contemporaries can be mentioned by the side
of the great names of the past. Italy has its skilful painters and sculptors,
its celebrated architects and unrivalled musicians. The great works achieved by
its engineers are deserving the study of foreigners. Amongst its physicists,
geologists, astronomers, and mathematicians there are some of the brightest
ornaments of the age, and the assiduity with which universities are frequented
insures their having worthy successors. A geographical society only recently
established has successfully taken up the work of exploration so gloriously carried
on by the Genoese and Venetians. It is not just, therefore, to say ironically
that “Italy has been made, but not Italians.” Individually the Italians are
inferior to no other race of Europe, and the reorganization of the country would
have been impossible had there been any deficiency in men of mark.</p>

<p>Italy is more densely inhabited than any other of the great states of Europe,
in spite of vast extents of almost uninhabitable mountain tracts and swamps.
The population, however, increases less rapidly than in Russia, England, or
Germany. It doubles in about a century, whilst that of Russia doubles in fifty
and that of France in two hundred years. Italy thus occupies an intermediate
position. In Apulia and Calabria, which are amongst the poorest provinces, the
birth rate is highest, whilst in the wealthy Marches and Umbria it is lowest. On
an average the Italian dies when he is thirty-two, and his life is consequently
much shorter than that of the average Frenchman or Englishman.</p>

<p>Agriculture and the development of the natural resources of the soil and the
sea engage much more attention than industry properly so called. Nearly
fifty per cent. of the total area is under cultivation. The cereals raised do
not suffice for the wants of the inhabitants, but other products are exported in
considerable quantities. In its production of oil Italy holds a foremost rank as
regards quantity, but not always with respect to quality. The amount of fruit
grown, such as figs, grapes, almonds, and oranges, is greater than in any other
country of Europe. The chestnut forests in the Apennines and Alps yield rich
harvests. Its mulberry plantations are four times more extensive than those of
France, and the raw silk produced in favourable years exceeds in quantity that
exported from China. The peninsula is still entitled to its
ancient epithet of <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span>
Œnotria (wine land), but, apart from certain districts of continental Italy and
Sicily, the quality of wine produced, owing to carelessness on the part of the
growers, is inferior to what it is in France. The cultivation of cotton is comparatively
of small importance. The breeding of animals yields large profits, and
Italy is noted throughout Europe for the quality of some kinds of cheese.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn120" id="fnanch120">120</a></p>

<p>The working of the iron mines of Elba, the quarrying of marble and granite in
the Alps and Apuanic Alps, the extraction of borax and boracic acid in the
Tuscan Sub-Apennines, the mining for lead and zinc in Sardinia, and for sulphur
in Sicily,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn121" id="fnanch121">121</a> lead up to industrial pursuits properly so called. These latter extend
nearly to everything, from the manufacture of pins to the construction of steam-engines
and ships. Italy, however, is eminent only in the production of certain
<i>articles de luxe</i>, such as straw bonnets, cameos, coral jewellery, glass, and in the
preparation of macaroni and other farinaceous pastes. The manufacture of silk,
however, has taken a rapid development in recent years, and Milan has become a
dangerous rival of Lyons. In the province of Novara, and more especially at
Biella, there are hundreds of woollen factories. The cotton manufacture is not of
much importance, and linen-weaving is for the most part carried on as a domestic
industry. Italy, in fact, cannot yet be called a manufacturing country. The number
of workmen is large, but they mostly labour at home or in small workshops,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn122" id="fnanch122">122</a> and
a division of labour, such as exists in England, France, or Germany, is hardly
known. Manufactories, however, are rapidly increasing, and economical conditions
are gradually becoming what they are already in most other countries of
Europe.</p>

<p>Italy possesses a powerful mercantile marine, manned by
150,000 seamen; but its foreign commerce is far less than
might have been expected from its tonnage.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn123" id="fnanch123">123</a> Most of
the vessels are engaged in the coasting trade. The first
Italian vessel was seen in the Pacific in 1847, and even
now the Italian flag is very inadequately represented in
the navigation of the great oceans. Italian patriots are
anxious to see the commerce of the country extended to the
most distant regions. For the present Italy enjoys a sort
of monopoly in the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and
any increase of <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span>
population or wealth in Northern Africa must prove of immediate advantage to it.
But there can be no doubt that the proposed railway from Antwerp or Calais to
Saloniki or Constantinople will seriously affect the transit trade of Italian ports.
Nor are Italian shipowners able to compete with their rivals of Marseilles or Trieste
when it is a question of speed, for the number of their steamers is very small.</p>

<p>The facilities for carrying on coasting trade have, in some measure, interfered
with the development of the inland trade of the country. The construction of
railways, however, is gradually bringing about a change. Already
five lines of <span class="xxpn" id="p356">{356}</span>
rails cross the Apennines, others are projected, and one of the Italian railways,
namely, that which pierces the Alps in the tunnel of Mont Cenis, and finally
follows the eastern coast to Rimini, has become a portion of the great European
highway to India. Nor must the political importance of these railways be underrated,
for they knit together the most distant provinces of Italy, and make the
country really one.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn124" id="fnanch124">124</a></p>

<p>The commerce of Italy has increased rapidly of late, but it is still inferior not
only to that of England, France, Germany, Austria, and Russia, but likewise to
that of much smaller countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands. In 1875
the imports, including transit, were estimated at £48,614,280, the exports at
£42,301,800. France participates in this commerce to the extent of 31 per cent.,
England is represented by 23, Austria by 20, and all the other countries of the
world share in the remainder. Recently the commerce with North and South
America has assumed considerable proportions, and efforts are being made to obtain
a footing in Eastern Asia.</p>

<p>The great scourge of Italy consists in the poverty of its peasantry even in
the most fertile provinces, as in Lombardy and the Basilicata. These peasants
live in foul hovels, and the united earnings of a whole family are hardly sufficient
to procure bread. Chestnuts, and a polenta of maize and paste made of damaged
flour, are the principal articles of food, and nothing is left for luxuries, or even
comfortable clothing. Rickets and other diseases brought about by an insufficiency
of food are common, and, in fact, mortality is very great. Emigration is under
these circumstances of immense advantage to the country, for the thousands of
Italians who seek work or found new homes in South America, the United States,
France, Turkey, Egypt, and elsewhere, not only earn their bread, but also render
some assistance to those of their relatives who remain behind. It is said that out
of 500,000 Italians living abroad, no less than 100,000 are engaged in art, either
as painters, sculptors, or musicians, the latter being frequently mere street-singers
or organ-grinders.</p>

<p>Ignorance, the usual companion of poverty, is still very great throughout the
peninsula. We might err in condemning the Italians because of their ignorance
of the arts of reading and writing, for, as the heirs of an ancient civilisation,
they are more polished in their manners than the educated peasants of the
North. Still this ignorance is most deplorable, for it precludes all progress.
Nearly two-thirds of the population over ten years of age are unable to read, and
fifty-nine men and seventy-eight women out of every hundred are unable to sign
the marriage registers. There are several thousand parishes without elementary
schools, and the number of pupils, instead of amounting to the normal proportion
of one to every six or seven inhabitants, is only one to about eleven.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn125" id="fnanch125">125</a> Education,
however, is making fair progress, but its influence upon the diminution of crimes
of violence has hitherto been small. In 1874 Signor Cantelli, the Home
Secretary, stated that there occurred annually 3,000 homicides, 4,000 cases of
highway robbery, and 30,000 violent assaults.</p>

<p>The permanent confusion of the finances of Italy, attended as it is by heavy
and vexatious taxes, must be looked upon as one of the principal causes which
retard the development of the country. The national debt may appear a small
matter if we compare it with that of France, but it has been
raised in the course <span class="xxpn" id="p358">{358}</span>
of a single generation, and is augmenting from year to year. The revenue
increases but the expenditure does so likewise, and the additional income
resulting from an increase of taxation and the sales of Church property is not
sufficient to cover the deficiency. The heavy cost of the army, an absence of
sustained efforts in carrying on public works, waste and fraud by public servants,
have hitherto prevented the establishment of a balance between income and
expenditure, and the paper money issued by Government is nowhere accepted at
its nominal value.</p>

<p>This disorganization of the finances places Italy at the mercy of foreigners,
and the arrangements which have to be made from time to time with foreign
capitalists are not always of a purely financial nature. The inefficiency of her
military and naval organization, moreover, compels her to cultivate foreign alliances
as expediency may direct, and to these alliances Italy is, in a large measure,
indebted for her political unity.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn126" id="fnanch126">126</a></p>

<p>Nor is this unity even now as perfect as could be desired. The Pope has been
deprived of his temporal power; he resides at the Vatican as a guest; and the
money offered him by the Italian Government, but which has never been accepted,
is not tribute, but a gratuity. But, in spite of this, the Pope is still a real power,
and his very presence interferes substantially with the permanent establishment
of the state. The Catholics of the world have not yet acquiesced in his disestablishment,
and they allow no opportunity for attacking the new order of things
to escape them. Political Europe is consequently much interested in the home
affairs of Italy, and feels tempted frequently to intervene. The most expert
diplomacy may not be able to avert this danger, and if there is a struggle it will
certainly not be confined to the peninsula.</p>

<p>In the end Italy will no doubt escape from the anomalous position of having
for her capital a city which is the seat of a theocratic government claiming the
allegiance of the Roman Catholics of the entire world. The geographical
conditions of no other country are equally favourable to the development of
national sentiments and the maintenance of a national individuality. At the
same time the well-defined boundaries of the country deprive it of all force of
expansion. Italy will never play a great part beyond the bounds of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
and though Italian may obtain a certain preponderance in Tunis, Egypt,
and the Levant, the noble language of Dante has no chance, as regards universality,
when opposed to English, French, Spanish, German, or Russian.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The
charter promulgated in March, 1848, declares the old kingdom of
Sardinia to be an hereditary constitutional monarchy. It has
gradually been <span class="xxpn" id="p359">{359}</span>
extended to the other portions of the peninsula. Like most similar documents, it
guarantees equality before the law, personal liberty, and inviolability of the domicile.
The press is free, “subject to a law repressing its abuses;” the right of
meeting is recognised, “but not in the case of places open to the general public;”
and all citizens are promised the enjoyment of equal civil and political rights,
“except in those cases which shall be determined by law.”</p>

<p>The executive is intrusted to the King, but no law or act of government is
valid unless countersigned by a minister. The King, as such, is commander of
the naval and military forces, he concludes all treaties, and the assent of the
Chambers is only required if they concern cessions of territory, or entail an
expenditure of public money. All Government officials are appointed by the King,
he may dissolve the Chamber of Deputies, justice is administered in his name,
and he possesses the right of pardon. He enjoys the fruits of the Crown lands,
and may dispose of his private property without reference to the general laws of
the country. The civil list of the King and the members of his family annually
exceeds £800,000&#x202f;!</p>

<p>Senators are appointed by the King from amongst ecclesiastical, military, and
civil functionaries, persons of wealth, and men who have deserved well of the
country. Their number is not limited, and they must be forty years of age.
Deputies are elected for five years. They must be thirty years of age. Neither
senators nor deputies are in receipt of emoluments, and this may explain the
little zeal they exhibit in the performance of their public duties. A quorum,
consisting of one-half the members of each house <i>plus</i> one, is frequently unattainable
for weeks.</p>

<p>The franchise is enjoyed by professors of universities and colleges, civil
servants, knights of orders of chivalry, members of the liberal professions,
merchants, persons who have an income of £24 from money invested in Government
securities, and all others twenty-five years of age, able to read and write,
and paying 32s. in taxes. The number of electors is about 400,000, but hardly
one-half of them ever go to the poll.</p>

<p>Each province occupies the position of a “corporation,” which may hold
property, and enjoys a certain amount of self-government. The “Provincial
Councils” consist of from twenty to sixty members, who are chosen by the
municipal electors for five years. These Councils usually occupy themselves
with the material interests of the province, and, when not sitting, are represented
by a “Deputation” charged with controlling the acts of the prefect.</p>

<p>The municipal organization is very similar to that of the provinces. The
Councils are elected for five years: all males of twenty-one years of age paying
from 4s. to 20s. in taxes (according to the importance of the municipality),
professors, civil servants, members of liberal professions, and soldiers who
have been decorated are in the enjoyment of the franchise. The Council meets
twice a year, and its sittings are held in public if a majority demands it. It
appoints a municipal <i>giunta</i> of from two to twelve members, charged with the
conduct of current affairs. The mayors, like the
provincial prefects, are <span class="xxpn" id="p360">{360}</span>
appointed by Government, but must be chosen from the members of the Municipal Council.</p>

<p>The great territorial divisions of the kingdom (see p. <a
 href="#p362" title="go to p. 362">362</a>) consist of 69
provinces and 284 circles (<i>circondarii</i>), or districts. These latter again are subdivided
into 1,779 judicial districts (<i>mandamenti</i>) and 8,360 communes. The
central Government is represented in the provinces by a prefect, in the districts
by a sub-prefect, and in the communes by a mayor, or <i>sindaco</i>. This system of
administration is very much like that existing in modern France.</p>

<p>The administration of justice was organized in 1865. In each commune there
is a “Conciliator,” appointed for three years by Government, on the presentation
of the Municipal Council. A “Pretor” administers justice at the capital of each of
the judicial districts: he is assisted by one or more Vice-pretors. Next follow 161
civil and correctional courts, 92 assize courts, 24 courts of appeal, 25 commercial
tribunals, and 4 courts of cassation; the latter at Florence, Naples, Palermo, and
Turin. The Code of Laws is an adaptation of the Code Napoléon, and breathes
the same spirit.</p>

<p>In military matters Prussia has served as a model. Every Italian, on attaining
his twenty-first year, becomes liable to serve in the army or navy. Men embodied
in the first category of the standing army (<i>esercito permanente</i>) remain from three
to five years under the colours, according to the arm to which they belong, and six to
seven years on furlough. The men of the second category, or reserve of the standing
army, drill fifty days, and are then dismissed to their homes. The “mobilised
militia” includes all men up to forty not belonging to the standing army. A
“levy en masse,” or <i>Milizia stanziole</i>, is provided for by law, but nothing has been
done hitherto to render it a reality. The standing army includes 90 regiments of
infantry, 20 regiments of cavalry, 14 of artillery, and 1 of engineers, and numbers
410,000 men; the reserve amounts to 180,000 men; the mobilised militia (247
battalions, 24 Alpine companies, 60 batteries, and 10 companies of engineers),
277,000, and 234,000 officers and men are stated to be under the colours. The
four great fortresses of the north are Verona, Mantua, Peschiera, and Legnago.
These form the famous “Quadrilateral.” Venice is likewise a place of great
strength, and made an heroic defence in 1849. Palmanova defends the frontier
between the Julian Alps and the Gulf of Trieste. Rocca d’Anfo, on an isolated
rock to the north of Lake Garda, commands the defiles of the Adige and Chiese.
Pizzighettone, on the Adda, is no longer of much importance, now that Italy has
acquired possession of the Quadrilateral; but Alessandria, at the confluence of the
Tanaro and Bormida, will always retain its rank as the great strategical centre of
Piemont, and one of the strongest places of Europe. Casale may be looked upon
as one of its outworks, and together with Genoa defends the passages of the
Apennines. Piacenza and Ferrara command important passages of the Po. The
other fortresses of Italy are Ancona in the centre; Porto Ferrajo in Elba; Gaeta,
Capua, and Taranto in the south; and Messina in Sicily.</p>

<p>The navy consists of 21 ironclads (179 guns, engines of 11,310 horse-power,
76,842 tons) and 51 wooden steamers, manned by 20,000
seamen. The great <span class="xxpn" id="p361">{361}</span>
naval arsenals and stations are at Spezia, Genoa, Naples, Castellamare di Stabbia,
Venice, Ancona, and Taranto.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church alone is acknowledged by the State, but all other
religions are tolerated. The conflict between Church and State is favourable to the
spread of Protestantism; but, apart from the Waldenses and a few foreigners in the
larger towns, there are no Protestants in Italy. Many of those, however, who are
nominally Catholics have ranged themselves amongst the enemies of their Church,
or are perfectly indifferent.</p>

<p>Italy occupies quite a special position in the world, owing to its being the seat
of the Papacy. Rome is the seat of two governments, viz. that of the King and
of the Sovereign Pontiff. The latter, though shorn of his temporal power, is
in principle one of the most absolute monarchs. Once elected Vicar of Jesus
Christ by the cardinals met in conclave, he is responsible to no one for his
actions, though it is customary for him to listen to the advice of the Sacred
College of Cardinals before deciding questions of importance. The Pope alone, of
all men, is infallible; he can efface the crimes of others, “bind and unbind,” and
holds the keys of heaven and hell, his power extending thus beyond the span of
man’s natural life.</p>

<p>The cardinals are the great dignitaries of this spiritual government. They
are created by the Pope. Their number is limited to 70, viz. 6 Cardinal Bishops
(who reside at Rome), 50 Cardinal Priests, and 14 Cardinal Deacons. The Cardinal
<i>Camerlengo</i> represents the temporal authority of the Holy See, and on the death of
a pope he takes charge of the Vatican and of the Fisherman’s Key, which is the
symbol of the power bestowed upon St. Peter and his successors. In special cases
the cardinals of the three orders may be convoked to an Œcumenical Council.
On the death of a pope the cardinals elect his successor, who must be fifty-five
years of age, and obtain two-thirds of the votes. His investment with the
pallium and tiara, however, only takes place after the assent of the Governments
of France, Spain, Austria, and Naples (now represented by Italy) has been
secured.</p>

<p>In virtue of the formula of “A free Church in a free State,” so frequently
repeated since Cavour, the Pope is permitted to enjoy sovereign rights. He
convokes councils and chapters, appoints all ecclesiastical officers, has his own
post-office and telegraph, his guard of nobles and of Swiss, pays no taxes, and
enjoys in perpetuity the palaces of the Vatican and Lateran, as well as the villa
of Castel-Gandolfo, on the Lake of Albano. In addition to this, he has been voted
by the Italian Parliament an annual “dotation” of £129,000. This grant, however,
he has not touched hitherto, but the “Peter’s pence,” collected by the
faithful in all parts of the world, amount to more than double that sum.</p>

<p>Italy is divided into 47 archiepiscopal and 206 episcopal sees. There are more
than 100,000 secular priests, and in 1866, when the monasteries and convents were
suppressed, their inmates receiving pensions from Government, there were 32,000
monks and 44,000 nuns. The ecclesiastical army consequently numbers 176,000
souls, and is nearly as numerous as the military force on
a peace footing. <span class="xxpn" id="p362">{362}</span></p>

with Sardinia, forms a world apart. At a remote epoch
these two islands were but one, and it is curious to find that
Corsica, which politically now forms part of France, is geographically
as well as historically much more Italian than its sister
island. A glance at a map is sufficient to convince us that Corsica
is a dependency of Italy, for while abyssal depths of more than 500 fathoms
separate it from Provence, it is joined to the coast of Tuscany by a submarine
plateau, the mountains of which rise above the surface of the waters as islands. The
climate and natural productions of the island are those of Italy, and the language
of its inhabitants is Italian. Purchased from the Genoese, then conquered by
main force, Corsica in the end voluntarily united its destinies with those of France.
It has now been connected for more than three generations with the latter, and
there can be no doubt that most of its citizens look upon themselves as Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Though only half the size of Sardinia, Corsica is nevertheless larger than an
average French department. The fourth island in size of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, it
follows next to Cyprus, but is far more important than that island, and only yields
to Sicily and Sardinia in wealth and population.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn128" id="fnanch128">128</a> It is a country of great natural
beauty. Its mountains, attaining an altitude of over 8,000 feet, remain covered
with snow during half the year, and the view from the summits embraces nearly
the whole of the island, its barren rocks, forests, and cultivated fields. Most of
the valleys abound in running water, and cascades glitter in all directions. Old
Genoese towers, standing upon promontories, formerly defended the entrance to
every bay exposed to incursions of the Saracens, but they are hardly more nowadays
than embellishments of the landscape.</p>

<p>Monte Cinto, the culminating point of the island, does not
pierce the region of <span class="xxpn" id="p364">{364}</span>
persistent snows. A huge citadel of granite, whose fastnesses afforded a shelter to
the Corsicans during their wars of independence, it rises in the north-western
portion of the island. From its summit we can trace the whole of the coast from
the French Alps to the Apennines of Tuscany. There are other peaks to the
north and south of it which almost rival it in height.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn129" id="fnanch129">129</a> This main chain of the
island consists throughout of crystalline rock. Transverse ridges connect it with
a parallel range of limestone mountains on the east, which extend northward
through the whole of the peninsula of Bastia, and shut in, farther south, the old
lake basin of Corte, now drained by the Golo, Tavignano, and other rivers. The
whole of the interior of Corsica may be described as a labyrinth of mountains, and
in order to pass from village to village it is necessary to climb up steep steps, or
<i>scale</i>, and to ascend from the region of olives to that of pasturage. The high-road
which joins Ajaccio to Bastia has to climb a pass 3,793 feet
in height (Fig. 134),
and even the road following the populous western coast ascends and descends continuously,
in order to avoid the promontories descending steeply into the sea.
These physical obstacles sufficiently explain why railways have not yet been
built.</p>

<p>The western coast of the island is indented by numerous gulfs and bays, which
resemble ancient fiords partly filled up by alluvial sediment.
On the eastern coast, <span class="xxpn" id="p365">{365}</span>
which faces Italy, the slopes are more gentle; the rivers are larger and more
tranquil, though not one of them is navigable; and the ground is more level.
This portion of the island is known as <i>Banda di Dentro</i>, or “inner zone,” in distinction
from the <i>Banda di Fuori</i>, or “exterior (western) zone.” The eastern coast
appears to have been upheaved during a comparatively recent epoch, and ancient
gulfs of the sea have been converted into lagoons and swamps, quite as dangerous
from their miasmatic exhalations as those of the sister island. If we add that the
mountains in the west obstruct the passage of the vivifying mistral, that the heat
in summer is great, and droughts frequent, we have said enough to account for
the insalubrity of the climate.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn130" id="fnanch130">130</a> The maritime basin between Corsica and Italy
is almost shut in by mountains, and purifying breezes are rare there. Between
Bastia and Porto-Vecchio not a single town or village is met with on the coast,
and in the beginning of July the peasantry retire to the hills in order to escape
the fever. Only a few guards and the unfortunate convicts shut up in the penitentiary
of Casabianca remain behind. Nothing more melancholy can be imagined
than these fertile fields deserted by their inhabitants. Plantations of eucalyptus
have been made recently with a view to the amelioration of the climate.</p>

<p>Owing to the great height of the mountains we are able to trace in Corsica
distinct zones of vegetation. Up to a moderate height the character of the
vegetation is sub-tropical, and resembles that of Sicily or Southern Spain. There
are districts which can be numbered amongst the most fertile of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.
One of these is the <i>Campo dell’Oro</i>, or “field of gold,” around Ajaccio,
where hedges of tree-like cacti separate the gardens and orchards; such, also, is
the country to the north of Bastia, with its aromatic flowers and luscious fruits.
Olive forests generally cover the lower hills, their silvery foliage contrasting with
the sombre verdure of the chestnut woods above. Balagna, near Calvi, on the
north-western coast of the island, is famous for its olives, whilst another valley, on
the opposite side of the island, near Bastia, can boast of the most magnificent
chestnut-trees. Chestnuts, in some parts, constitute the
principal article of food, <span class="xxpn" id="p366">{366}</span>
and enable the inhabitants, who are by no means distinguished for their industry,
to dispense with the cultivation of cereals. Some political economists have
actually proposed to fell these trees, in order that the inhabitants may be forced
to work.</p>

<p>Chestnut-trees grow up to a height of 6,250 feet. The virgin forests which
formerly extended beyond them to the zone of pasturage have for the most part
disappeared. In the upper Balagna valley, Valdoniello, and Aitone, however,
magnificent forests may still be seen, and a larch (<i>Pinus altissimus</i>), the finest
conifer of all Europe, attains there a height of 160 feet. These splendid trees,
unfortunately, are rapidly disappearing. They are being converted into masts, or
sawn into staves and planks.</p>

<p>The pasturing grounds above these forests are frequented during summer by
herdsmen with their flocks of sheep and goats. The agile moufflon is still met
with there in a few rocky recesses, and the shepherds assert that wild boars,
though very numerous on the island, carefully avoid its haunts. The wolf is
unknown in the island, and the bear has disappeared for more than a century.
Foxes of large size and small deer complete the fauna of the forest region of
Corsica. The <i>malmignata</i> spider, whose bite is sometimes mortal, is probably of
the same species as that of Sardinia and Tuscany; the <i>tarentula</i> is the same as
that of Naples, but the venomous ant known as <i>innafantato</i> appears to be peculiar
to the island.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We know nothing about the origin of the aboriginal inhabitants of Corsica.
There are neither nuraghi, as in Sardinia, nor other antiquities enabling us to
form an opinion with respect to their manners. But there exist near Sartène and
elsewhere several dolmens, or <i>stazzone</i>, menhirs, or <i>stantare</i>, and even avenues
of stones, which are similar in all respects to those of Brittany and England. We
may assume, therefore, that these countries were formerly inhabited by the same
race.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Corte, in the interior of the island, and the mountaineers of
Bastelica, boast of being Corsicans of the purest blood. At Bastia the type is
altogether Italian, but as we travel into the interior we meet men with large
fleshy faces, small noses devoid of character, clear complexion, and eyes of a chestnut
colour rather than black. Phocæans, Romans, and Saracens, who maintained
themselves here until the eleventh century, were succeeded by Italians and French.
Calvi and Bonifacio were Genoese settlements, and at Carghese, near Ajaccio, we
even meet with a colony of Greek Mainotes, who settled there in the seventeenth
century, and whose descendants now speak Greek, Italian, and French. But, in
spite of these foreign immigrations, the Corsicans have in a large measure retained
their homogeneity. Paoli was rather proud of a Genoese proverb, which said
that the “Corsicans deserved to be hanged, but knew how to bear it.” History
bears, indeed, witness to their patriotism, fearlessness, and respect for truth; but it
also tells us of foolish ambitions, jealousies, and a furious spirit of revenge. Even
in the middle of last century the practice of the vendetta cost
a thousand lives <span class="xxpn" id="p367">{367}</span>
annually. Entire villages were depopulated, and in many parts every peasant’s
house was converted into a fortress, where the men were constantly on the alert,
the women, protected by custom against outrage, sallying forth alone to cultivate
the fields. The ceremonies observed when a victim of the vendetta was brought
home were terrible. The women gathered round the corpse, and one amongst
them, in most cases a sister of the deceased, furiously called down vengeance upon
the head of the murderer. The <i>voceri</i> of death are amongst the finest national
songs. Foreign domination is to blame, no doubt, for the frequency of these
assassinations. The judges sent to the country did not enjoy the confidence of the
inhabitants, and these latter returned to the primitive law of retaliation.</p>

<p>Though Corsica gave a master to France, the spirit of the people is essentially
republican. The Romans barely succeeded in enslaving it, and even in
the tenth century the greater portion of the island formed a confederation of
independent communities known as <i>Terra del Comune</i>. The inhabitants of each
valley formed a <i>pieve</i> (<i>plebs</i>), by whom were elected a <i>podesta</i> and the “fathers of
the commune.” These latter appointed a “corporal,” who was charged with the
defence of popular rights. The podestas in turn elected a Council of twelve, who
stood at the head of the confederation. This constitution survived conquest and
invasion. In the eighteenth century, when fighting heroically against Genoa and
France, Corsica declared all citizens equal. It was institutions like these which
made Rousseau say that “that little island would one day astonish Europe.”
Since that time the Napoleonic era has whetted the ambition of the Corsicans,
and they appear to have forgotten their traditions of freedom.</p>

<p>Corsica is one of the least-populated departments of France.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn131" id="fnanch131">131</a> The eastern
slope of the island, though more fertile and extensive than the western, and
formerly densely peopled, is now almost a desert. The Roman colony of Mariana
no longer exists, and the Phocæan emporium of Aleria has dwindled down since
the thirteenth century into an isolated homestead standing close to a pestiferous
swamp. At the present time the great centres of population are on the western
coast, which faces France, enjoys a salubrious climate, and possesses magnificent
ports.</p>

<p>The Corsicans certainly appear to deserve the charge of idleness which is
brought against them, for they have done but little to develop the great resources
of their island. Fishing and cattle-breeding they understand best. In many
parts agricultural operations are carried on almost exclusively with the help of
Italian labourers, known as Lucchesi, because most of them formerly came from
Lucca. Thanks, however, to the impulse given by France, a commencement has
been made in the cultivation of the soil, and olive oil, equal to the best of Provence,
wine, and dried fruits already constitute important articles of export.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn132" id="fnanch132">132</a></p>

<p>Corsica abounds in ores, but they do not appear to be as
rich as those of Sardinia. Formerly iron mines alone were
worked, the ore being conveyed to the <span class="xxpn" id="p368">{368}</span>
furnaces near Bastia and Porto Vecchio; but of late years copper mines have been
opened at Castifao, near Corte, and argentiferous lead is being procured from a
mine near Argentella, not far from Ile Rousse. Red and blue granite, porphyry,
alabaster, serpentine, and marble are being quarried. There are many mineral
springs, but the only one enjoying a European reputation is that of Orezzo, which
rises in the picturesque district of Castagniccia. Its ferruginous water contains
a considerable quantity of carbonic acid, and is recommended as efficacious in a
host of diseases.</p>

<p>The most important town of Corsica, though not its capital, is Bastia, thus
named from a Genoese castle built towards the close of the fourteenth century on
the beach of the hill village of Cardo. Bastia stands about a mile to the north of
the two former capitals of the island, viz. Mariana and Biguglia, of which the
former has left no trace, whilst the latter has dwindled down to a miserable
village. The geographical position of Bastia is excellent, for it is within easy
reach of Italy, and frequent communications with that country have exercised a
most happy influence upon its inhabitants, who are the most civilised and industrious
of the whole island. Its harbour is small, and far from safe, but it is much
frequented. The city rises am­phi­thea­tri­cal­ly upon hills, and is surrounded by
delightful gardens and numerous villas. <span class="xxpn" id="p369">{369}</span></p>

<p>St. Florent, only six miles from Bastia, but on the western coast of the island,
has an excellent harbour, but the atmosphere hanging over its marshes is deadly.
Ile Rousse, farther to the west, is the principal port of the fertile district of
Balagna. It was founded by Paoli in 1758, in order to ruin Calvi, which had
remained faithful to the Genoese. This object has been attained. Ile Rousse
exports large quantities of oil and fruit, whilst the old town of Calvi, on its
whitish rock, is a place without life, frequently visited by malaria. The coast to
the south of Calvi, as far as the Gulf of Sagone, though exceedingly fertile, is
almost a desert, and many parts of it suffer from malaria. Ajaccio, however, at
one time merely a maritime suburb of Castelvecchio, standing a short distance
inland, has risen into great importance. It is the pleasantest and best-built
town of the island, and Napoleon, the most famous of its sons, showered favours
upon it. The inhabitants fish and cultivate their fertile orchards. They also
derive great advantages from a multitude of visitors, who go thither to enjoy a
delicious climate and picturesque scenery.</p>

<p>The other towns of Corsica are of no importance whatever. Sartène, though
the capital of an arrondissement, is merely a village, and the activity of the district
centres in the little port of Propriano, on the Gulf of Valinco, one of the
trysting-places of Neapolitan fishermen. Corte is famous in the history of the
island as the birthplace of the heroes of the wars of independence. Porto Vecchio,
though in possession of the best harbour of the island, is frequented only by a few
coasting vessels, whilst Bonifacio, an ancient ally of the Genoese, is important only
because of its fortifications. The prospect from the isolated limestone rock upon
which it is built is exceedingly picturesque. The mountains of Limbara stand
out clearly against the sky, and in front we look down upon the granitic islets
dotting the Strait of Bonifacio, so dangerous to navigators. It was here the
frigate <i>La Sémillante</i> foundered in 1855, with nearly a thousand souls on board.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn133" id="fnanch133">133</a></p>

Iberian peninsula, Spain and Portugal, must be looked upon
geographically as one. Differences of soil, climate, and language
may have justified its division into two states, but in the organism
of Europe these two constitute but a single member, having
the same geological history, and exhibiting unity in their physical
configuration.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn135" id="fnanch135">135</a></p>

<p>Compared with the other peninsulas of Southern Europe, viz. Italy and that of
the Balkans, Iberia is most insular in its character. The isthmus which attaches
it to the trunk of Europe is comparatively narrow, and it is defined most distinctly
by the barrier of the Pyrenees. The contour of the peninsula is distinguished
by its massiveness. There are curving bays, but no inlets of the sea penetrating
far inland, as in the case of Greece.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn136" id="fnanch136">136</a></p>

<p>It was said long ago, and with justice, that Africa begins at the Pyrenees.
Iberia, indeed, bears some resemblance to Africa. Its outline is heavy, there are
hardly any islands along its coasts, and few plains open out upon the sea. But it
is an Africa in miniature, only one-fiftieth the size of the continent upon which it
appears to have been modelled. Moreover, the oceanic slope of the peninsula is
quite European as to climate, vegetation, and abundance
of running water; and <span class="xxpn" id="p371">{371}</span>
certain features of its flora even justify a belief that at some remote epoch it was
joined to the British Islands. African Hispania only begins in reality with the
treeless plateaux of the interior, and more especially with the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
coasts. There we meet the zone of transition between the two continents. Its
general aspect, flora, fauna, and even population, mark out that portion of Spain
as an integral part of Barbary; the Sierra Nevada and the Atlas, facing each
other, are sister mountains; and the strait which separates them is a mere accident
in the surface relief of our planet.</p>

<p>Spain, though nearly surrounded by the sea, is nevertheless essentially continental
in its character. Nearly the whole of it consists of table-lands, and only
the plains of the Tajo (Tagus) and of Andalusia open out broadly upon the ocean.
The coast, for the most part, rises steeply, and the harbours are consequently difficult
of access to the inhabitants of the interior, a circumstance most detrimental
to the development of a large sea-borne commerce.</p>

<p>Ever since the discovery of the ocean high-roads to America and the Indies, the
Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula has taken the lead
in commercial matters, <span class="xxpn" id="p372">{372}</span>
a fact easily accounted for by the physical features of the country. Spain, like
peninsular Italy, turns her back upon the east. The plateaux slope down gently
towards the west; the principal rivers, the Ebro alone excepted, flow in that direction;
and the water-shed lies close to the Me­di­ter­ra­nean shores.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Spain must either have given birth to an aboriginal people, or was peopled by
way of the Pyrenees and by emigrants crossing the narrow strait at the columns of
Hercules. The Iberian race actually forms the foundation of the populations of
Spain. The Basks, or Basques, now confined to a few mountain valleys, formerly
occupied the greater portion of the peninsula, as is proved by its geographical nomenclature.
Celtic tribes subsequently crossed the Pyrenees, and established themselves
in various parts of the country, mixing in many instances with the Iberians, and
forming the so-called Celtiberians. This mixed race is met with principally in
the two Castiles, whilst Galicia and the larger portion of Portugal appear to be
inhabited by pure Celts. The Iberians had their original seat of civilisation in
the south; they thence moved northward along the coast of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
penetrating as far as the Alps and the Apennines.</p>

<p>These original elements of the population were joined by colonists from the
great commercial peoples of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. Cádiz and Málaga were founded
by the Phœnicians, Cartagena by the Carthaginians, Saguntum by immigrants from
Zacynthus, Rosas is a Rhodian colony, and the ruins of Ampurias recall the Emporiæ
of the Massilians. But it was the Romans who modified the character of the
Iberian and Celtic inhabitants of the peninsula, whom they subjected after a
hundred years’ war. Italian culture gradually penetrated into every part of the
country, and the use of Latin became universal, except in the remote valleys
inhabited by the Basques.</p>

<p>After the downfall of the Roman empire Spain was successively invaded by
Suevi, Alani, Vandals, and Visigoths, but only the latter have exercised an
abiding influence upon the language and manners of the Spaniards, and the
pompous gravity of the Castilian appears to be a portion of their heritage.</p>

<p>To these northern invasions succeeded an invasion from the neighbouring
continent of Africa. The Arabs and Berbers of Mauritania gained a footing upon
the rock of Gibraltar early in the eighth century, and very soon afterwards nearly
the whole of Spain had fallen a prey to the Mussulman, who maintained himself
here for more than seven centuries. Moors immigrated in large numbers, and they
substantially affected the character of the population, more especially in the south.
The Inquisition expelled, or reduced to a condition of bondage, hundreds of
thousands of these Moors, but its operations only extended to Mussulmans or
doubtful converts, whilst Arab and Berber blood had already found its way into
the veins of the bulk of the population. Castilian bears witness to the great
influence of the Saracens, for it contains many more words of Arabic than
of Visigothic origin, and these words designate objects and ideas evidencing a
state of progressive civilisation, such as existed when the Arabs of Córdova and
Granada inaugurated the modern era of science and
industry in Europe. <span class="xxpn" id="p373">{373}</span></p>

<p>During the dominion of the Moors the Jews prospered singularly on the soil of
Spain, and their number at the time of the first persecution is said to have been
800,000. Supple, like most of their faith, they managed to get a footing in both
camps, the Christian and Mo­ham­me­dan, and enriched themselves at the expense of
each. They supplied both sides with money to carry on the war, and, as farmers of
taxes, they oppressed the inhabitants. The Christian faith triumphed in the end; the
kings, to pay the cost of their wars, proclaimed a crusade against the Jews; and the
people threw themselves with fury upon their hated oppressors, sparing neither iron,
fire, tortures, nor the stake. A few Jewish families may have escaped destruction
by embracing Catholicism, but the bulk of that people perished or were driven into
exile.</p>

<p>Far happier has been the lot of the Gipsies, or <i>Gitanos</i>, who are sufficiently
numerous in Spain to give a special physiognomy to several large towns. These
Gipsies have always conformed outwardly to the national religion, and the Inquisition,
which has sent to the stake so many Jews, Moors, and heretics, has never
interfered with them. The Gipsies, in many instances, have settled down in the
towns, but they all have traditions of a wandering life, and most highly respect
those of their kinsmen who still range the woods and plains. These latter are
proud of their title of <i>viandantes</i>, or wayfarers, and despise the dwellers in towns.
These Spanish Gitanos appear to be the descendants of tribes who sojourned for
several generations in the Balkans, for their lingo contains several hundred words
of Slav and Greek origin.</p>

<p>M. de Bourgoing has drawn attention to the great diversity existing amongst
the population of Spain. A Galician, for instance, is more like an Auvergnat
than a Catalonian, and an Andalusian reminds us of a Gascon. Most of the
inhabitants, however, have certain general features, derived from a common
national history and ancestry.</p>

<p>The average Spaniard is of small stature, but strong, muscular, of surprising
agility, an indefatigable walker, and proof against every hardship. The sobriety
of Iberia is proverbial. “Olives, salad, and radishes are fit food for a nobleman.”
The physical stamina of the Spaniard is extraordinary, and amply explains the ease
with which the <i>conquistadores</i> surmounted the fatigues which they were exposed to
in the dreaded climate of the New World. These qualities make the Spaniard the
best soldier of Europe, for he possesses the fiery temperament of the South joined
to the physical strength of the North, without standing in need of abundant
nourishment.</p>

<p>The moral qualities of the Spaniard are equally remarkable. Though careless
as to every-day matters, he is very resolute, sternly courageous, and of great
tenacity. Any cause he takes up he defends to his last breath. The sons always
embrace the cause of their fathers, and fight for it with the same resolution.
Hence this long series of foreign and civil wars. The recovery of Spain from the
Moors took nearly seven centuries; the conquest of Mexico, Peru, and South
America was one continued fight lasting throughout a century. The war of independence
which freed Spain from the yoke of Napoleon was
an almost unexampled <span class="xxpn" id="p374">{374}</span>
effort of patriotism, and the Spaniards may justly boast that the French did not
find a single spy amongst them. The two Carlist wars, too, would have been
possible nowhere else but in Spain.</p>

<p>Who need wonder, after this, if even the lowliest Spaniard speaks of himself with
a certain haughtiness, which in any one else would be pronounced presumptuous?
“The Spaniard is a Gascon of a tragic type;” so says a French traveller. With him
deeds always follow words. He is a boaster, but not without reason. He unites
qualities which usually preclude each other, for, though haughty, he is kindly in
his manners; he thinks very highly of himself, but is considerate of the feelings of
others; quick to perceive the shortcomings of his neighbours, he rarely makes
them a subject of reproach. Trifles give rise to a torrent of sonorous language,
but in matters of importance a word or a gesture suffices. The Spaniard combines
a solemn bearing and steadfastness with a considerable amount of cheerfulness.
Nothing disquiets him; he philosophically takes things as they are; poverty has no
terrors for him; and he even ingeniously contrives to extract pleasure and advantage
from it. The life of Gil Blas, in whom the Spaniards recognise their own likeness,
was more chequered than that of any other hero of romance, and yet he was
always full of gaiety, which even the dark shadow of the Inquisition, then resting
upon the country, failed to deprive him of. “To live on the banks of the
Manzanares,” says a Spanish proverb, “is perfect bliss; to be in paradise is the second
degree of happiness, but only on condition of being able to look down upon Madrid
through a skylight in the heavens.”</p>

<p>These opposites in the character of the Spaniards give rise to an appearance of
fickleness which foreigners are unable to comprehend, and they themselves complacently
describe them as <i>cosas de España</i>. How, indeed, are we to explain so
much weakness associated with so many noble qualities, so many superstitions in
spite of common sense and a keen perception of irony, such ferocity of conduct in men
naturally generous and magnanimous? A Spaniard, in spite of his passions, will
resign himself philosophically to what he looks upon as inevitable. <i>Lo que ha de
ser no puede faltar</i>, “What is to be will be,” he says, and, wrapped up in his cloak,
he allows events to take their course. The great Lord Bacon observed, three hundred
years ago, that the “Spaniards looked wiser than they were;” and, indeed, most
of them are passionately fond of gambling, and their apathetic fatalism accounts
for many of the ills their country suffers. The rapid decay which has taken
place in the course of three centuries has led certain historians to number the
Spaniards amongst fallen nations. The edifices met with in many towns and
villages speak of a grandeur now past, and the <i>despoblados</i> and <i>dehesas</i>, which we
encounter even in the vicinity of the capital, tell of once fertile fields returned
to a state of nature.</p>

<p>Buckle, in his “History of Civilisation,” traces this decay to the physical
nature of Spain and to a long succession of religious wars. The Visigoths defended
Arianism against the Franks, and when the Spaniards had become good Catholics
their country was invaded by Moors, and for more than twenty generations they
struggled against them. It thus happened that patriotism
became identical with <span class="xxpn" id="p375">{375}</span>
absolute obedience to the behests of the Church, for every one, from the King down
to the meanest archer, was a defender of the faith rather than of his native soil.
The result might have been foretold. The Church not only took possession of most
of the land won from the infidels, but it also exercised a baneful influence upon the
Government, and, through its dreaded tribunals of the Inquisition, over the whole
of society.</p>

<p>But whilst these long religious struggles tended to the moral and intellectual
abasement of the Spaniards, there were other causes which operated in an inverse
sense, and these Buckle does not appear to have properly appreciated. The kings,
in order to secure the support of the people in their wars against the Mussulmans,
found themselves compelled to grant a large measure of liberty. The towns
governed themselves, and their delegates, as early as the eleventh century, sat with
the nobility and clergy in the Cortes, and voted the supplies. Local government
conferred advantages upon Spain then enjoyed only in few parts of Europe.
Industry and the arts flourished in these prosperous cities, and a stop was even
put to the encroachments of the clergy long before Luther raised his powerful
voice in Germany.</p>

<p>A struggle between the supporters of local government and of a centralized
monarchy at length became imminent, and no sooner had the infidels been expelled
than civil war began. It terminated in favour of King and Church, for the
<i>comuneros</i> of the Castiles met with little support in the other provinces, and their
towns were ravaged by the bloodthirsty generals of Charles V.</p>

<p>The discovery of the New World, which happened about this period, proved a
disaster to Spain, for young men of enterprise and daring crossed the Atlantic,
and thus weakened the mother country, which was too small to feed such huge
colonies. The immense amount of treasure (more than £2,000,000,000 between
1500 and 1702) sent home from the colonies contributed still further to the rapid
decay of Spain, for it corrupted the entire nation. Money
being obtainable without <span class="xxpn" id="p376">{376}</span>
work, all honest labour ceased, and when the colonies no longer yielded their
metallic treasures the country saw itself impoverished, for the gold and silver
had found their way to foreign lands, whence Spain had procured her supplies.</p>

<p>History affords no other example of so rapid a decadence brought about without
foreign aggression. The workshops were closed, the arts of peace forgotten,
the fields but indifferently cultivated. Young men flocked to the 9,000 monasteries
to enjoy a life of indolence, and “science was a crime, ignorance and
stupidity were the first of virtues.” Population decreased, and the Spaniard even
lost his ancient renown for bravery. If the Bourbon kings placed foreigners in
all high positions of state, they did so because the Spaniards had become incapable
of conducting public business.</p>

<p>But if we compare the Spain of our own days with the Spain of the Inquisition,
we cannot fail to be struck with the vast progress made. Spain is no longer
a “happy people without a history,” for ever since the beginning of the century
it has been engaged in struggles, and during this period of tumultuous life it
has done more for arts, science, and industry than in the two centuries of peace
which succeeded the dark reign of Philip II. No doubt Spain
might have done <span class="xxpn" id="p377">{377}</span>
even more if the strength of the country had not been wasted in internal struggles.
Unfortunately the geographical configuration of the peninsula is unfavourable to
the consolidation of the nation. The littoral regions combine every advantage of
climate, soil, and accessibility, whilst the resources of the inland plateaux are
comparatively few. The former naturally attract population; they abound in
large and bustling cities, and are more densely populated than the interior of the
country. Madrid, which occupies a commanding position almost in the geometrical
centre of the country, has become a focus of life, but its environs are very
thinly inhabited.</p>

<p>This unequal distribution of the population could not fail to exercise a powerful
influence upon the history of the country. Each of the maritime provinces felt
sufficiently strong to lead a separate existence. During the struggles with the
Moors common interests induced the independent kingdoms of Iberia to co-operate,
and facilitated the establishment of a central monarchy; but, to maintain this unity
afterwards, it became necessary to have recourse to a system of terrorism and
oppression. Portugal, being situated on the open Atlantic, shook off the detested
yoke of Castile after less than a century’s submission. In the rest of the
peninsula political consolidation is making progress, thanks to the facilities of
in­ter­com­mu­ni­ca­tion and the substitution of Castilian for the provincial dialects;
but it would be an error to suppose that Andalusians and Galicians, Basques and
Catalans, Aragonese and Madrileños, have been welded into one nation. Indeed,
the federal constitution advocated by Spanish republicans appears to be best suited
to the geographical configuration of the country and the genius of its population.
The desire to establish provincial autonomy has led to most of the civil wars of
Spain, whether raised by <i>Carlists</i> or <i>Intransigentes</i>. It is therefore meet that, in
our description of Spain, we should respect the limits traced by nature, bearing
in mind the fact that the political boundaries of the province do not always
coincide with water-sheds or linguistic boundaries.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The
great central plateau of the peninsula is bounded on the north, east, and
south by ranges of mountains extending from the Cantabrian Pyrenees to the
Sierra Morena, and slopes down in the west towards Portugal and the Atlantic.
The uplands through which the Upper Duero, the Tajo (Tagus), and the Guadiana
take their course are thus a region apart, and if the waters of the ocean were to
rise 2,000 feet, they would be converted into a peninsula attached by the narrow
isthmus of the Basque provinces to the French Pyrenees. The vast extent of
these plateaux—they constitute nearly half the area of the whole country—accounts
for the part they played in history, and their commanding position enabled the
Castilians to gain possession of the adjacent territories. <span class="xxpn" id="p378">{378}</span></p>

<p>The Castiles can hardly be called beautiful, or rather their solemn beauty does
not commend them to the majority of travellers. Vast districts, such as the Tierra
de Campos, to the north of Valladolid, are ancient lake beds of great fertility, but
exceedingly monotonous, owing to the absence of forests. Others are covered with
small stony hillocks; others, again, may be described as mountainous. Mountain
ranges covered with meagre herbage bound the horizon, and sombre gorges,
enclosed between precipitous walls of rock, lead into them. Elsewhere, as in the
Lower Estremadura, we meet with vast pasture-lands, stretching as far as the eye
can reach to the foot of the mountains, and, as in certain parts of the American
prairies, not a tree arrests the attention. Looking to the fearful nakedness of
these plains, one would hardly imagine that a law was promulgated in the middle
of last century which enjoins each inhabitant to plant at least five trees. Trees,
indeed, have been cut down more rapidly than they were planted. The peasants
have a prejudice against them; their leaves, they say, give shelter to birds, which
prey upon the corn-fields. Small birds, nightingales alone excepted, are pursued
without mercy, and a proverb says that “swallows crossing the Castiles must
carry provisions with them.” Trees are met with only in the most remote
localities. The hovels of the peasantry, built of mud or pebbles, are of the same
colour as the soil, the walled towns are easily confounded with the rock near them,
and even in the midst of cultivated fields we may imagine ourselves in a desert.
Many districts suffer from want of water, and villages which rejoice in the possession
of a spring proclaim the fact aloud as one of their attributes. Huge bridges
span the ravines, though for more than half the year not a drop of water passes
over their pebbly beds.</p>

<p>The Sierra de Guadarrama and its western continuation, the Sierra de Gredos,
separate this central plateau of Spain into two portions, lying at different
elevations. Old Castile and Leon, which lie to the north, in the basin of the
Duero, slope down from east to west from 5,600 to 2,300 feet; whilst New Castile
and La Mancha, in the twin basins of the Tajo and the Guadiana, have an average
elevation of only 2,000 feet. In the tertiary age these two plateaux were covered
with huge lakes. One of them, the contours of which are indicated by the débris
carried down from the surrounding hills, originally discharged its waters in the
direction of the valley of the Ebro, but subsequently opened itself a passage
through the crystalline mountains of Portugal, now represented by the gorges of
the Lower Duero. At another epoch this Lake Superior communicated with the
lake which overspread what are now the plains of New Castile and La Mancha.
The area covered by these two lakes amounted to 30,000 square miles, and Spain
was then a mere skeleton of crystalline mountains, joined together by saddles of
triassic, Jurassic, and cretaceous age, enclosing these two fresh-water lakes, and
bounded exteriorly by the ocean. This geological period must have been of very
long duration, for the lacustrine deposits are sometimes nearly a thousand feet in
thickness. The miocene strata which form the superficial deposits of these two lake
basins of the Castiles are geologically of the same age, for fossil bones of the
same great animals—megatheria, mammoths, and hipparions—are
found in both. <span class="xxpn" id="p379">{379}</span></p>

<p>The Cantabrian Mountains bound Leon and Old Castile towards the north-west
and north, but broad mountain ranges run out from these immediately to the east
of the Peña Labra, and form the water-shed between the basin of the Duero and
the head-stream of the Ebro. These ranges are known by various names. They
form first the <i>Páramos</i> of Lora (3,542 feet), which slope gently towards the south,
but sink down abruptly to the Ebro, which flows here in a gorge many hundred
feet in depth. The water-shed to the east of these continues to the mountain
pass of the Brujula, across which leads the road (3,215 feet) connecting Burgos
with the sea. Beyond this pass the so-called <i>Montes</i> of Oca gradually increase in
height, and join the crystalline Sierra de Demanda, culminating in the Pico de
San Lorenzo (7,554 feet). Another mountain mass lies farther to the south-east.
It rises in the Pico de Urbion to a height of 7,367 feet, and gives birth to the
river Duero. The water-shed farther on is formed by the Sierra Cebollera
(7,039 feet), which subsides by degrees, its ramifications extending into the basins
of the Ebro and Duero. The Sierra de la Moncayo (7,905 feet), a crystalline
mountain mass similar to the San Lorenzo, but exceeding it in height, terminates
this portion of the enceinte of the central plateau. The broad ranges beyond
offer no obstacles to the construction of roads, but there are several rugged ridges
to the south of the Cebollera and Moncayo, which force the Duero to take a
devious course through the defile of Soria. Numantia, the heroic defence of
which has since been imitated by many other towns of the peninsula, stood near
that gorge.</p>

<p>The average height of the mountains separating the basin of the Duero from
that of the Tajo is more than that of those in the north-east of Old Castile. The
mountains gradually increase in height towards the west and south-west, until
they form the famous Sierra de Guadarrama, the granitic rocks of which bound the
horizon of Madrid in the north. It constitutes a veritable wall
between the two <span class="xxpn" id="p380">{380}</span>
Castiles, and the construction of the roads which lead in zigzag over its passes of
Somosierra (4,680 feet), Navacerrada (5,834 feet), and Guadarrama (5,030 feet)
was attended with difficulties so considerable that Ferdinand VI., proud of the
achievement, placed the statue of a lion upon one of the highest summits, and thus
recorded that the “King had conquered the mountains.” This sierra forms a
natural rampart to the north of the plains of Madrid, and many sanguinary
battles have been fought to secure a passage through them. The railway to
Madrid avoids them, but the depression of Ávila, through which it passes, is
nevertheless more elevated than the summit of the Mont Cenis Railway.</p>

<p>The mountains to the south-west of the Peak of Peñalara (7,870 feet), which
is the culminating point of the sierra, sink down rapidly, and at the Alto de la
Cierva (6,027 feet) the chain divides into two branches, of which the northern
forms the water-shed between the Duero and the Tajo, whilst the more elevated
southern chain joins the Sierra de Guadarrama to the Sierra de Gredos, but is cut
in two by the defile excavated by the river Alberche, which rises to the north
of it.</p>

<p>The Sierra de Gredos is, next to the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada of
Granada, the most elevated mountain chain of Spain, for in the Plaza del Moro
Almanzor it attains a height of 8,680 feet, and thus reaches far beyond the zone
of trees. Its naked summits of crystalline rocks remain covered with snow
during more than half the year. The country extending along
the southern slope <span class="xxpn" id="p381">{381}</span>
of these mountains is one of the most delightful districts of all Spain. It
abounds in streams of sparkling water; groups of trees are dotted over the hill-slopes
and shield the villages; and Charles V., when he selected the monastery of
St. Yuste as the spot where he proposed to pass the remainder of his days, exhibited
no mean taste. In former times the foot of the sierra was much more
frequented, for the Roman road known as <i>Via Lata</i> (now called <i>Camino de la Plata</i>)
crossed immediately to the west of it, by the Puerto de Baños, and thus joined the
valley of the Duero to that of the Tajo.</p>

<p>The Sierra de Gata, which lies beyond this old road, has a course parallel with
that of the Sierra de Gredos, and this parallelism is observable likewise with respect
to the minor chains and the principal river beds of that portion of Spain. The
Sierra de Gata rises to a height of 5,690 feet in the Peña de Francia, thus named
after a chapel built by a Frankish knight. Within its recesses are the secluded
valleys of Las Batuecas and Las Hurdes.</p>

<p>In the eastern portion of New Castile the country is for the most part undulating
rather than mountainous, and, if the deep gorges excavated by the rivers
were to be filled up, would present almost the appearance of plains. The most
elevated point of this portion of the country is the Muela de San Juan (5,900 feet),
in the Montes Universales, thus called, perhaps, because the Tajo, the Júcar, the
Guadalaviar, and other rivers flowing in opposite directions take their rise there.</p>

<p>The Sierra del Tremendal, in the district of Albarracin, farther north, is said
to be frequently shaken by earthquakes, and sulphurous gases escape there where
oolitic rocks are in contact with black porphyry and basalt. Several triassic
hills in the vicinity of Cuenca are remarkable on account of their rock-salt, the
principal mines of which are those of Minglanilla.</p>

<p>Farther south the height of land which separates the rivers flowing to the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean from those tributary to the Tajo and Guadiana is undulating, but
not mountainous. We only again meet with real mountains on reaching the
head-waters
of the Guadiana, Segura, and Guadalimar, where the Sierra Morena, forming
for 250 miles the natural boundary between La Mancha and Andalusia, takes
its rise. Seen from the plateau, this sierra has the appearance of hills of moderate
height, but travellers facing it from the south see before them a veritable mountain
range of bold profile, and abounding in valleys and wild gorges. Geographically
this sierra belongs to Andalusia rather than to the plateau of the Castiles.</p>

<p>In the west, judging from the courses of the Tajo and the Guadiana, the country
would appear to subside by degrees into the plains of Portugal; but such is not the
case. The greater portion of Estremadura is occupied by a mountain mass consisting
of granite and other crystalline rocks. The sedimentary strata of the
region bounded in the north by the Sierras of Gredos and Gata, and in the south
by the Sierra de Aroche, are but of small thickness. In former times these
granitic mountains of Estremadura retained pent-up waters of the lakes which then
covered the interior plateaux, until the incessant action of water forced a passage
through them. Their highest summits form a range between the rivers Guadiana
and Tajo known as the Sierra of Toledo, and attain a height of
5,115 feet in <span class="xxpn" id="p382">{382}</span>
the Sierra de Guadalupe, famous in other days on account of the image of a
miracle-working Virgin Mary, an object of veneration to Estremeños and Christianized
American Indians.</p>

<p>Geologically the series of volcanic hills known as Campo de Calatrava (2,270
feet) constitute a distinct group. They occupy both banks of the Guadiana, and the
ancient inland lake now converted into the plain of La Mancha washed their foot.
From their craters were ejected trachytic and basaltic lavas, as well as ashes, or
<i>negrizales</i>, but acidulous thermal springs are at present the only evidence of subterranean
activity.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The rivers of the Castiles are of less importance than might be supposed from
a look at a map, for, owing to a paucity of rain, they are not navigable. The
moisture carried eastward by the winds is for the most part
precipitated upon the <span class="xxpn" id="p383">{383}</span>
exterior slopes of the mountains, only a small proportion reaching the Castilian
plateaux. Evaporation, moreover, proceeds there very rapidly, and if it were not
for springs supplied by the rains of winter there would not be a single perennial
river.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn138" id="fnanch138">138</a></p>

<p>Of the three parallel rivers, the Duero, the Tajo, and the Guadiana, the latter
two are the most feeble, for the supplementary ranges of the Sierras of Gredos and
Guadarrama shut off their basins from the moisture-laden winds of the Atlantic. Yet,
in spite of their small volume, the geological work performed by them in past
ages was stupendous. Both find their way through tortuous gorges of immense depth
from the edge of the plateaux down to the plains of Lusitania. The gorge of the
Duero forms an appropriate natural boundary between Spain and Portugal, for it
offers almost insurmountable obstacles to in­ter­com­mu­ni­ca­tion. The more considerable
tributaries of the Duero—such as the Tormes, fed by the snows of the
Sierra de Gredos; the Yéltes; and the Agueda—likewise take their course through
wild defiles, which may be likened to the <i>cañons</i> of the New World. The Tajo
presents similar features, and below its confluence with the Alberche it enters a
deep defile, hemmed in by precipitous walls of granite.</p>

<p>The Guadiana passes through a similar gorge, but only after it has reached
the soil of Portugal. The hydrography of its head-streams, the Giguela and
Záncara, which rise in the Serranio of Cuenca, offers curious features; but, as
they are for the most part dry during summer, the bountiful springs known as
the <i>ojos</i>, or “eyes,” of the Guadiana are looked upon by the inhabitants as the
true source of the river. They are three in number, and yield about four cubic
yards of water a second. These springs are popularly believed to be fed by the
Ruidera, which, after having traversed a chain of picturesque lakelets, disappears
beneath a bed of pebbles; but Coello has shown that after heavy rains this head-stream
of the Guadiana actually reaches the Záncara.</p>

<p>The climate of the Castilian plateaux is quite continental in its character.
The prevailing winds of Spain are the same as in the rest of Western Europe, but
the seasons and sudden changes of temperature in the upper basins of the Duero, the
Tajo, and the Guadiana recall the deserts of Africa and Asia. The cold in winter is
most severe, the heat of summer scorching, and the predominating winds aggravate
these features. In winter, the <i>norte</i>, which passes across the snow-covered Pyrenees
and other mountain ranges, sweeps the plains and penetrates through every
crevice in the wretched hovels of the peasants. In summer a contrary wind, the
<i>solano</i>, penetrates through breaks in the Sierra Nevada and Sierra Morena,
scorches the vegetation, and irritates man and animals. The climate of Madrid<a class="afnanch" href="#fn139" id="fnanch139">139</a>
is typical of that of most of the towns of Castile. The air, though pure, is exceedingly
dry and penetrating, and persons affected with diseases of the throat run
considerable risk during their period of acclimation. “The air of Madrid does
not put out a candle, but kills a man,” says a proverb, and the climate of that
city is described as “three months of winter and nine of hell.”
True, in the <span class="xxpn" id="p384">{384}</span>
time of Charles V., Madrid enjoyed the reputation of having an excellent climate,
and it is just possible that its deterioration may be ascribable to the destruction of
the forests.</p>

<p>The greatest variety of plants is met with if we ascend from the plains to the
summits of the mountains, but taken as a whole the vegetation is singularly
monotonous, for the number of plants capable of supporting such extremes of
temperature is naturally limited. Herbs and shrubs predominate. The thickets
in the upper basin of the Duero and on the plateaux to the east of the Tajo and the
Guadiana consist of thyme, lavender, rosemary, hyssop, and other aromatic plants;
on the southern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains heaths with small pink flowers
predominate; vast areas in the mountains of Cuenca are covered with Spanish
broom, or esparto; and saline plants abound in the environs of Albacete. These
regions are generally described as the “Steppes of
Castile,” though “deserts” <span class="xxpn" id="p385">{385}</span>
would, perhaps, be a more appropriate term. For miles around the village of San
Clemente not a rivulet, a spring, or a tree is met with, and the aspect of the
country throughout is exceedingly dreary. The interminable plains of La Mancha—the
“dried-up country” of the Arabs—adjoin these steppes in the west, and
there corn-fields, vineyards, and pasture-grounds alternate with stretches of thistles,
and the monotony is partly relieved by the windmills, with their huge sweeps slowly
revolving overhead. Estremadura and the slopes of the Sierra Morena are principally
covered with rock-roses, and from the summit of some hills a carpet of <i>jarales</i>,
bluish green or brown, according to the season, extends as far as the eye reaches,
and in spring is covered with an abundance of white flowers resembling newly
fallen snow.</p>

<p>Woods are met with only on the slopes of the mountains. Oaks of various
species and chestnut-trees occupy the lower zone, and conifers extend beyond them
to the extreme limit of trees. These latter likewise cover the vast tracts of shifting
sands which extend along the northern foot of the Sierra de Guadarrama, and are
the analogue of the French <i>landes</i>.</p>

<p>The remains of the ancient forests still shelter wild animals. In the beginning
of this century bears were numerous on the southern slopes of the Cantabrian
Mountains; the thickets of Guadarrama, Gredos, and Gata still harbour wolves,
lynxes, wild cats, foxes, and even wild goats. Deer, hares, and other game abound.
The oak forests are haunted by wild boars of immense size and strength. Before
the downfall of Islam it was thought meritorious to keep large herds of pigs, and
a traveller who visits the remote villages of Leon, Valladolid, and Upper Estremadura
will find that this ancient custom still survives. The black hogs of Trujillo
and Montanchez are famous throughout Spain for their excellent hams.</p>

<p>The country offers great facilities for the breeding of sheep and cattle; there
are, however, several districts which are admirably suited to the production of cereals.
The Tierra de Campos, in the basin of the Duero, is one of them. It owes its
fertility to a subterranean reservoir of water, as do also the <i>mesa</i> of Ocaña and
other districts in the upper basins of the Tajo and the Guadiana, which are arid only
in appearance. The vine flourishes on stony soil, and yields excellent wine, and
the same may be said of the olive-tree, which constitutes the wealth of the
Campo de Calatrava. Agricultural pursuits would thus appear to offer great
advantages; and if thousands of acres are still allowed to lie fallow, if nomad
habits still predominate, this is owing to sloth, force of habit, the existence of
feudal customs, and sometimes, perhaps, to discouragement produced by seasons
of drought.</p>

<p>Most of the herds of <i>merinos</i> are obliged to traverse nearly half Spain in
search of the food they require. Each herd of about 10,000 sheep is placed
in charge of a <i>mayoral</i>, assisted by <i>rabadanes</i> in charge of detachments of from
1,000 to 1,200 animals. The shepherds and sheep of Balia, in Leon, are reputed
to be the best. In the beginning of April the merinos leave their pasture-grounds
in Andalusia, La Mancha, and Estremadura for the north, where they pass the
summer, returning in September to the south. It may readily
be imagined that <span class="xxpn" id="p386">{386}</span>
these wandering herds do much damage to the fields through which they pass,
even though the privileges of the sheep-breeders were abrogated in a large measure
in 1836. Spain, however, in spite of every advantage offered by nature, is obliged
now to import sheep from abroad to improve its flocks. Mules, too, which are
almost indispensable in so stony a country, are imported from France. Camels,
llamas, and kangaroos have been introduced, but their number has never been
large, and the fauna as well as the flora of the Castiles bears the stamp of monotony.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As is the land, so are its inhabitants. The men of Leon and the Castiles are
grave, curt of speech, majestic in their gait, and of even temper. Even in their
amusements they carry themselves with dignity, and those amongst them who
respect the traditions of the good old time regulate every movement in accordance
with a most irksome etiquette. The Castilian is haughty in the extreme, and <i>Yo
soy Castellano&#x202f;!</i> cuts short every further explanation. He recognises no superiors,
but treats his fellows on a footing of perfect equality. A foreigner who mixes
for the first time in a crowd at Madrid or elsewhere in the Castiles cannot fail
of being struck by the natural freedom with which rich and poor converse with
each other.</p>

<p>The Castilian, thanks to his tenacious courage and the central position he
occupies, has become the master of Spain, but he can hardly be said to be the
master in his own capital. Madrid is the great centre of attraction of the entire
peninsula, and its streets are crowded with provincials from every part of
Spain. This invasion of the capital, and of the Castiles generally, is explained by
the sparseness of the population of the plateaux, a sparseness not so much due to
the natural sterility of the country as to political and social causes. There can
be no doubt that the Castiles formerly supported a much denser population than
they do now, but the towns of the valleys of the Tajo and the Guadiana have shrunk
into villages, and the river, which was formerly navigable as far as Toledo, is so
no longer, either because its volume is less now than it used to be, or because its
floods are no longer regulated. Estremadura, at present one of the poorest
provinces of Spain, supported a dense population in the time of the Romans,
who founded there the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which became the
largest town of Iberia. During the dominion of the Moors, too, Estremadura
yielded bounteous harvests, but the old cities have disappeared, and the fields are
now covered with furze, broom, and rock-roses.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the Moors no doubt contributed towards the decay of these
once fertile regions, but the principal cause must be looked for in the growth of
feudal, military and ecclesiastical institutions, which robbed the cultivator of the
fruits of his labours. Subsequently, when Cortes, Pizarro, and other <i>conquistadores</i>
performed their prodigious exploits in the New World, they attracted the enterprising
youth of the province. The peaceable cultivation of the soil was held in
contempt, fields remained untilled, and 40,000 nomadic shepherds took possession
of the country. It is thus the <i>Estremeños</i> became what they are, the “Indians”
of the nation. <span class="xxpn" id="p387">{387}</span></p>

<p>This decrease of population was unfortunately attended by a return towards
barbarism. Three hundred years ago the region on the southern slopes of the
Sierra de Guadarrama was famous for its industry. The linen and cloth of Ávila,
Medina del Campo, and Segovia were known throughout Europe; Burgos and
Aranda del Duero were the seats of commerce and industry; and Medina de
Rio Seco was known as “Little India,” on account of the wealth displayed at its
fairs. But misgovernment led to the downfall of these industries, the country
became depopulated, and its ancient culture dwindled to a thing of the past. At the
famous university of Salamanca the great discoveries of Newton and Harvey were
still ignored at the close of last century as being “contrary to revealed religion,”
and the lower classes grovelled in the most beastly superstitions.</p>

<p>In this very province of Salamanca, close to the Peña de Francia, exist the
“barbarous” Batuecas, who are charged with not being able to distinguish
the seasons. Nor are the inhabitants of other remote mountain districts of
the Castiles what we should call civilised. Amongst these may be noticed the
<i>charros</i> of Salamanca and the famous <i>maragatos</i> of Astorga, most of them
muleteers. They only intermarry amongst themselves, and are looked upon as
the lineal descendants of some ancient tribe of Iberia. The suggestion that
they are a mixed race of Visigoths and Moors is not deserving of attention,
for neither in their dress nor in their manners do they remind us of Mussulmans.
They wear loose trousers, cloth gaiters fastened below the knee, a short and
close-fitting coat, a leather belt, a frill round the neck, and a felt hat with a
broad brim. They are tall and strong, but wiry and angular. Their taciturnity
is extreme, and they neither laugh nor sing when driving before them
their beasts of burden. It is difficult to excite their passion, but, once roused,
they become ferocious. Their honesty is above suspicion, and they may be safely
trusted with the most valuable goods, which they will defend against every
attack, for they are brave, and skilled in the use of arms. Whilst the men
traverse the whole of Spain as carriers of merchandise, the women till the soil,
which, being arid and rocky, yields but a poor harvest.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The vicissitudes of history explain the existence of numerous towns in the
Castiles which can boast of having been the capital of the country at one time or
other. Numantia, the most ancient of all those cities, exists no longer, and the
learned are not yet agreed whether the ruins discovered near the decayed town of
Soria are the remains of the walls demolished by Scipio Æmilianus. But there are
several cities of great antiquity which possess some importance even at the present
day. Leon is one of these. It was the head-quarters of a Roman legion
(<i>septima gemina</i>), and its name, in reality a corruption of <i>legio</i>, is supposed to be
symbolized by the lions placed in its coat of arms. Leon was one of the first
places of importance taken from the Moors. Its old walls are in ruins now, and
the beautiful cathedral has been transformed into a clumsy cube. Astorga, the
“magnificent city” of Asturica Augusta, has fallen even lower than Leon, whilst
Palencia (the ancient Pallantia) still enjoys a certain measure
of prosperity, owing <span class="xxpn" id="p388">{388}</span>
to its favourable geographical position at the Pisuerga, which has caused it to
be selected as one of the great railway centres of the peninsula.</p>

<p>Burgos, the former capital of Old Castile, points proudly to its graceful cathedral
and other ancient buildings, but its streets are nearly deserted, and the crowds
which congregate occasionally in the churches, hotels, or at the railway station
are composed, for the most part, of beggars. In the cathedral are preserved
numerous relics, and the Cid, whose legendary birthplace, Bivar, is near, lies buried
in it.</p>

<p>Valladolid, the Belad Walid of the Moors, at one time the capital of all Spain,
enjoys a more favourable geographical position than Burgos. It lies on the Lower
Pisuerga, where that river enters the broad plain of the Duero, at an elevation
of less than 600 feet above the sea. There are numerous factories, conducted
by Catalans, and the city boasts, like Burgos, of many curious buildings and
historical reminiscences. The houses in which Columbus died and Cervantes was
born are still shown, as is the beautiful monastery of San Pablo, in which resided
Torquemada, the monk, who condemned 8,000 heretics to die at the stake. The
castle of Simancas, where the precious archives of Spain are kept, is near this
city.</p>

<p>Descending the Duero, we pass Toro, and then reach Zamora, the “goodly
walls” of which proved such an obstacle to the Moors. Zamora, though on the
direct line between Oporto and continental Europe, is an
out-of-the-way place at <span class="xxpn" id="p389">{389}</span>
present, and the same may be said of the famous city of Salamanca, on the
Tormes, to the south of it.</p>

<p>Salamanca, the Salmantica of the Romans, succeeded to Palencia as the seat of
a university, and during the epoch of the Renaissance was described as the “mother
of virtues, sciences, and arts,” and the “Rome of the Castiles.” It still deserves
the latter epithet, because of its magnificent bridge built by Trajan, and the beautiful
edifices dating back to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Its intellectual
superiority, however, is a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Arevalo, and the famous town of Medina del Campo, to the north-east of Salamanca,
carry on a considerable trade with corn. Ávila occupies an isolated hillock
on the banks of the Adaja, to the north of the Sierra de Gredos. Ávila still preserves
its turreted walls of the fifteenth century, and its fortress-like cathedral is a marvel
of architecture. There are also curious sculptures of animals,
which are ascribed <span class="xxpn" id="p390">{390}</span>
to the aboriginal inhabitants of the country. Similar works of rude art in the
vicinity are known as the “bulls of Guisando,” from a village in the Sierra de
Gredos.</p>

<p>Segovia the “circumspect” is situated on an affluent of the Duero, like
Ávila, and in the immediate vicinity of the Sierra de Guadarrama. Its turreted
walls rise on a scarped rock, supposed to resemble a ship. On the poop of this
fancied ship, high above the confluence of the Clamores and Eresma, rise the
ruins of the Moorish Alcázar, whilst the cathedral, in the centre of the city, is
supposed to represent the mainmast. A beautiful aqueduct supplies Segovia with
the clear waters of the Guadarrama. It is the finest Roman work of this class in
Iberia, and far superior to the royal palace of San Ildefonso or of La Granja, in
the neighbourhood of the city.</p>

<p>Toledo is the most famous city to the south of the great
rampart formed by the <span class="xxpn" id="p391">{391}</span>
Sierras of Guadarrama, Gredos, and Gata. This is the <i>Ciudad Imperial</i>, the
“mother of cities,” the coronet of Spain and the light of the world, as it was
called by Juan de Padilla, the most famous of its sons. Tradition tells us that it
existed long before Hercules founded Segovia, and, like Rome, it stands upon seven
hills. Toledo, with its gates, towers, Moorish and mediæval buildings, is indeed a
beautiful city, and its cathedral is of dazzling richness. But, for all this, Toledo is
a decayed place, and its famous armourers’ shops have been swamped by a
Government manufactory.</p>

<p>Talavera de la Reyna, below Toledo, on the Tajo, still possesses some of its
ancient manufactures of silk and faience. Puente del Arzobispo and the other
towns on the Tajo are hardly more now than large villages. The bridge of Almaraz
crosses the river far away from any populous town, and the old Roman bridge
of Alconétar exists no longer. Alcántara,—that is, <i>the</i> bridge,—near the Portuguese
frontier, still remains a monument of the architectural skill of the
Romans. It was completed in the year 105, in the reign of Trajan, and its
architect, Lacer, appears to have been a Spaniard. Its centre is at an elevation
of 160 feet above the mean level of the Tajo, the floods of which rise occasionally
to the extent of a hundred feet.</p>

<p>All the great towns of Estremadura lie at some distance from the Tajo, and
its great volume of water has hitherto hardly been utilised for purposes of
irrigation or navigation. On a fertile hill nearly twenty miles to the north of
this river, the old town of Plasencia may be seen bounded in the distance by
mountains frequently covered with snow. Cáceres is about the same distance
to the south, as is also Trujillo, which received such vast wealth from the conquerors
of Peru, but is now dependent upon its pigs and herds of cattle.</p>

<p>The position of those towns of Estremadura which lie on the banks of the
Guadiuna is more favourable. Badajoz, close to the Spanish frontier, has lost its
ancient importance as a fortress since it became a place of commerce on the only
railway which as yet joins Spain to Portugal. Mérida, on the same railway, is
richer in Roman monuments than any other town of Spain, for there are a
triumphal arch, the remains of an aqueduct, an amphitheatre, a naumachy, baths,
and an admirable bridge of eighty granite arches, 2,600 feet in length; but in
population it is far inferior to Don Benito, a town hardly mentioned in history,
higher up the Guadiana, at the edge of the vast plain of La Serena. It was founded
in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and together with its neighbour,
Villanueva de la Serena, derives its wealth from the fertility of the surrounding
country. Its fruits, and particularly its water-melons, are much esteemed. The
plains on the right bank of the Guadiana abound in phosphate of lime, which is
exported to France and England.</p>

<p>The towns of La Mancha are of no historical note, and the province owes
its celebrity almost exclusively to Cervantes’ creation, the incomparable “Don
Quixote.” Ciudad Real, an industrious place formerly; Almagro, known for its
point-lace; Daimiel, near which stood the principal castle of the military order of
Calatrava; Manzanares; and other towns are important principally
because of their <span class="xxpn" id="p392">{392}</span>
trade in corn and wine. Almaden,—that is, “the mine,”—in a valley on the
northern slope of the Sierra Morena, has become famous through its cinnabar
mines, which for more than three centuries supplied the New World with
mercury, and still yield about 1,200 tons annually.</p>

<p>Eastern Castile, being at a considerable elevation above the sea-level, and
having a rugged surface, cannot support a population more dense than either La
Mancha or Estremadura. There are but few towns of note, and even the capital,
Cuenca, is hardly more than a third-rate provincial
city. Picturesquely perched <span class="xxpn" id="p393">{393}</span>
upon a steep rock overhanging the deep gorges of the Huecar and Júcar, it merely
lives in the past. The only other towns of note in that part of the country are
Guadalajara, with a Roman acqueduct, and Alcalá, the native place of Cervantes
and seat of an ancient university, which at one time saw 10,000 students within its
walls. Both these towns are situated on the Henares, a tributary of the Tajo,
and either would have been fit to become the capital of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Indeed, at the first glance, it almost appears as if Madrid owed its existence to
the caprice of a king. It has no river, for the Manzanares is merely a torrent, its
climate is abominable, and its environs present fewer advantages than those of
Toledo, the ancient capital of the Romans and Visigoths. But once having been
selected as the capital, Madrid could not fail to rise in importance, for it occupies a
central position with respect to all other towns outside the basin of the Upper Tajo.
Pinto (<i>Punctum</i>), a short distance to the south of Madrid, is popularly supposed to
be the mathematical centre of the peninsula; and thus much is certain, that the plain
bounded in the north by the Sierra de Guadarrama forms the natural nucleus of
the country, and is traversed by its great natural highways.</p>

<p>Toledo occupies a position almost equally central. It was the capital of the
country during the reign of the Romans, and subsequently became the capital of
the ecclesiastical authorities and of the kings of the Visigoths, and retained that
position until it fell into the power of the Moors. During the struggles between
Moors and Christians the latter shifted their capital from place to place, according
to the varying fortunes of the war, but no sooner had the former been expelled
from Córdova than the Christian kings again established themselves in the plain
to the south of the Sierra de Guadarrama. They had then to choose between Toledo
and Madrid. Toledo no doubt offered superior advantages, but its citizens having
joined the insurrection of the <i>comuneros</i> against Charles V., the Emperor-king decided
in favour of Madrid. Philip III. endeavoured to remove the capital to Valladolid,
but the natural attractions of Madrid proved too strong for him, and the schools,
museums, public buildings, and manufactories which have arisen in the latter since
then must for ever insure it a preponderating position. The railways, which now
join Madrid to the extremities of the peninsula, countervail the disadvantages
of its immediate neighbourhood; and although the purest Castilian is spoken at
Toledo, it is Madrid which, through its press, has insured the preponderance of that
idiom throughout Spain. Madrid has long been in advance of all other cities of the
peninsula as regards political activity, industry, and commerce, but its growth
having taken place during a period devoid of art, it is inferior to other towns with
respect to the character of its public buildings. The museums, however, are
amongst the richest in Europe, and make it a second Florence. Immediately
outside the public promenades of the Prado and Buen Retiro we find ourselves
in a desolate country covered with flints, and this must be crossed by
a traveller desirous of visiting the delightful gardens of Aranjuez, the huge
Escorial built by Philip II., or the villas in the wooded valleys of the Sierra de
Guadarrama. These latter supply Madrid with water, as the neighbouring mountains
do with ice. Formerly one of the most secluded of
these valleys became <span class="xxpn" id="p394">{394}</span>
the seat of a mock-kingdom, nominally independent of the Kings of Castile.
During the Moorish invasion the inhabitants of the plain of Jarama had sought
shelter in the mountains, and the rest of the world forgot all about them. They
called themselves Patones, and elected an hereditary king. About the middle of
the seventeenth century the last of the line, by trade a carrier, surrendered his
wand of authority into the hands of a royal officer, and the valley was placed
under the jurisdiction of the authorities at Uceda.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn140" id="fnanch140">140</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">Andalusia
embraces the whole of the basin of the Guadalquivir,
together with some adjoining districts. It is bounded in the north by
the Sierra Morena, which in the direction of Portugal becomes a rugged
mountain district of crystalline formation intersected by tortuous
ravines, and rising in the Sierra de Aracena, north of the mining
region of the Rio Tinto, to a height of 5,500 feet. Farther east the
Sierra Morena ascends in terraces above the valley of the Guadalquivir,
and on its reverse slope we meet with districts, such as that of Los
Pedroches (1,650 feet), hardly less monotonous of aspect than the
plains of La Mancha. The <span class="xxpn" id="p395">{395}</span>
Punta de Almenara (5,920 feet), in the Sierra de Alcaraz, in the
extreme east, may be looked upon as the culminating point of this
sierra, which is indebted for its name of “Black Mountain” to the
sombre pines which clothe its slopes.</p>

<p>The line of water-parting does not pass through the highest summits of
this range. Most of the rivers rise on the plateau, and take their course, by
picturesque gorges, right through the heart of the mountains. The most famous
of these gorges is that of Despeñaperros (2,444 feet), leading from the dreary
plains of La Mancha to the smiling valley of Andalusia. This pass has played a
great part in every war. At its foot was fought in 1212 the fearful battle of
Navas de Tolosa, in which more than 200,000 Mussulmans are said to have been
slaughtered.</p>

<p>The mountains which shut in the basin of Andalusia on the east are cut up
by deep river gorges into several distinct masses or chains, of which the Calar
del Mundo (5,437 feet), Yelmo de Segura (5,925 feet), and Sierra Sagra (7,675
feet) are the principal. The southern mountain ranges uniformly extend from east
to west. From north to south we cross in succession the Sierras de María (6,690
feet), de las Estancias, and de los Filabres (6,283 feet), so famous for its marbles.
In the west the latter two ranges join the Sierra de Baza (6,236 feet), itself attached
to the great culminating range of Iberia, the Sierra Nevada, by a saddle of inconsiderable
height (2,950 feet). <span class="xxpn" id="p396">{396}</span></p>

<p>The Sierra Nevada consists mainly of schists, through which eruptions of
serpentine and porphyry have taken place. The area it occupies is small, but
from whatever side we approach it rises precipitously, and the eye can trace the
succeeding zones of vegetation up to that of perennial snows pierced by the peaks
of Mulahacen (11,661 feet), Picacho de la Veleta (11,386 feet), and Alcazaba
(7,590 feet). Vines and olive-trees clothe the foot-hills; to these succeed walnut-trees,
then oaks, and finally a pale carpet of turf hidden beneath snow for six
months. Masses of snow accumulate in sheltered hollows, and these <i>ventisqueros</i>,
<i>ventiscas</i>, or snow-drifts, supply Granada with ice. In the <i>Corral de la Veleta</i> there
even exists a true glacier, which gives birth to the river Genil, and is the most
southerly in all Europe. The more extensive glaciers of a former age have
disappeared long ago. To the purling streams fed by the snows of the sierra the
Vega of Granada owes its rich verdure, its flowers, and its excellent fruits, and the
delightful valley of Lecrin its epithet of “Paradise
of the Alpujarras.”</p>

<p>No other district of Spain so forcibly reminds us of the dominion of the Moors.
The principal summit is named after a Moorish prince. On the Picacho they lit a
beacon on the approach of a Christian army, and in the Alpujarras, on the
southern slope, they pastured their sheep. The Galician and Asturian peasants,
who now occupy this district, are superior in no respect to the converted Moors
who were permitted to remain at Ujijar, the capital of Alpujarras, when their
compatriots were driven forth. The natural riches of the mountains remain
undeveloped, and they are surrounded by a belt of <i>despoblados</i>.</p>

<p>From the Pass of Alhedin (3,300 feet), between Granada and Alpujarra, we look
down upon one of the most charming panoramas of the world. It was here that
Boabdil, the fugitive Moorish king, beheld for the last time the smiling plains of
his kingdom, and hence the spot is known as the “Last Sigh of the Moor,” or the
“Hill of Tears.” From the highest summits of the sierra, however, the prospect
is exceedingly grand. Standing upon the Picacho de la Veleta,
we see Southern <span class="xxpn" id="p398">{398}</span>
Spain spread out beneath our feet, with its fertile valleys, rugged rocks, and
russet-coloured wilds. Looking south, across the blue waters of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
the mountains of Barbary loom out in the distance, and sometimes we are even able
to hear the murmuring of the waves as they beat against the coast.</p>

<p>The mountains around these giants of Granada are very inferior to them in
height. The country in the north, which is bounded by the valleys of the Genil,
Guadiana Menor, and Guadalquivir, is occupied by an upland intersected by deep
ravines, and rising now and then into distinct mountain chains, such as the Sierra
Magina (7,047 feet) and Sierra de Jabalcuz, near Jaen (1,800 feet); the chain
Alta Coloma, farther south, with its wild pass, Puerto de Arenas, between Jaen
and Granada; and the Sierra Susana, close to Granada, which extends westward
to the mountain mass of the Parapanda, the great prophet of the husbandmen of
the Vega:―</p>

<div class="dpoem fsz6"><div class="nowrap">
<p class="pv0"><span class="spqut">“</span>Cuando
 Parapanda se pone la montera,</p>
<p class="pv0"><span class="spqutspc">L</span>lueve,
 aunque Dios no lo quisiera.”</p></div>

<div class="padtopc fsz7">(“When Parapanda puts on his cap it rains,
 though God may not wish it.”)</div>
</div><!--dpoem-->

<p>The mountains extending along the coast are cut up by transverse valleys into
several distinct masses. The Sierra de Gata, in the south-east, is a detached
mountain mass, pierced by several extinct volcanoes. Farther west rises the
Sierra Alhamilla, the torrents of which are so rich in garnets that the huntsmen
use them instead of shot. Crossing a rivulet, we reach the superb Sierra de Gádor
(7,620 feet), consisting of schists.</p>

<p>The Contraviesa (6,218 feet), which separates the Alpujarras from the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
rises so steeply from the coast that even sheep can hardly climb it. The
Sierra de Almijara, beyond the narrow valley of the Guadalfeo, and its western
continuation, the Sierra de Alhama (7,003 feet), present similar features. The
mountains on the other side of the Pass of Alfarnate or de los Alazores (2,723
feet) constitute the exterior rampart of an ancient lake bed, bounded in the north
by an irregular swelling of ground known as Sierra de Yeguas. The road from
Málaga to Antequera crosses that rampart in the famous Pass of El Torcal (4,213
feet), the fantastically shaped rocks of which bear some resemblance to the ruins
of an extensive city. Archæologists have discovered there some of the most curious
prehistoric remains of Iberia.</p>

<p>To the west of the basin of Málaga, drained by the Guadalhorce, the emissary
of the ancient lake referred to above, the mountains again increase in height, and
in the Sierra de Tolox attain an elevation of 6,430 feet. Snows remain here
throughout the winter. From the Tolox mountain chains ramify in all directions.
The Sierra Bermeja (4,756 feet) extends to the south-west, its steep promontories
being washed by the waves of the sea; the wild “Serrania” de Ronda (5,085 feet)
extends westward, and is continued in the mountain mass of San Cristóbal
(5,627 feet), which sends branches southward as far as the Capes of Trafalgar and
Tarifa. The rock of Gibraltar (1,408 feet), which rises so proudly at the entrance
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, is a geological outlier attached to the mainland by a strip of
sand thrown up by the waves of the ocean.</p>

<p>Erosion has powerfully affected the mountains occupying the country between
the basin of the Guadalquivir and the coast. Amongst the numerous river gorges,
that of the Gaytanos, through which the Guadalhorce flows from the plateau of
Antequera to the orange groves of Alora, is one of the wildest and most magnificent
in all Spain. Only torrents enter the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and even of the rivers
discharging their waters into the Atlantic there is but one which is of some
importance, on account of its great volume and the facilities it offers for navigation.
This is the Guadalquivir, which rises in the Sierra Sagra, at an elevation of 5,900
feet above the sea-level. Having received the Guadalimar, its current becomes
gentle, and it flows through a wide and open valley, thus differing essentially
from the rivers of the Castiles, which, on their way to the sea, traverse narrow
gorges. Its volume fairly entitles it to its Arab name of Wad-el-Kebir, or “large
river.” The geological work performed by this river and its tributaries has been
enormous. Mountain ramparts have been broken through, lakes drained, and
immense quantities of soil spread over the valley. Nowhere can this work be
traced more advantageously than in the valley of the Genil of Granada, for the
fertile district of La Vega was covered by a lake, the pent-up waters of which
opened themselves a
passage near Loja. <span class="xxpn" id="p400">{400}</span></p>

<p>The estuary of the river has been gradually filled up by sediment. The tide
ascends nearly as far as Seville, where the river is about 250 yards wide. Below
that city it passes through an alluvial tract known as the <i>marismas</i>, ordinarily a
dusty plain roamed over by half-wild cattle, but converted by the least rain into a
quagmire. Neither villages nor homesteads are met with here, but the sands
farther back are covered with dwarf palms, and lower down a few hills of tertiary
formation approach close to the river, their vine-clad slopes affording a pleasing
contrast to the surrounding solitude.</p>

<p>A contraction of the alluvial valley marks the exterior limit of the ancient
estuary silted up by the Guadalquivir. Sanlúcar de Barrameda, a town of
oriental aspect, stands on the left bank, whilst a range of dunes intervenes
between the sea and the flat country on the right bank. The mouth of the river
is closed by a bar, so that only vessels of small draught can enter it. These
<i>Arenas Gordas</i>, or “great sands,” are for the most part covered with pines, and,
except on their exterior face, they have remained stable since the historical epoch.</p>

<p>The Guadalquivir is the only river of Spain which is navigable for a considerable
distance above its mouth. Vessels of 200 tons ascend it as far as Seville, a
distance of sixty miles. Sanlúcar was formerly the great port of Spain, and its
coasting trade is still considerable. None of the other rivers of Andalusia are
navigable. The Guadalete, which enters the Bay of Cádiz, is a shallow, sluggish
stream; the Odiel and the Rio Tinto are rapid torrents, and their estuary, below
Huelva, has been choked up by the sediment brought down by them; while Palos,
so famous as the port from which Columbus started upon his great voyage of discovery,
has dwindled down to a poor fishing village.</p>

<p>But what are these changes compared with the great revolution which joined
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean to the Atlantic? There can be no doubt that a barrier of
mountains separated the two seas. The destructive action of the Atlantic appears
to have been facilitated not only by the cavernous nature of the rocks on
both sides of the strait, but also by the fact of the level of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
having been much lower at that time than that of the Atlantic. Even now the
waters of the latter sometimes rush through the strait with astounding velocity
(see Fig. <a href="#fg006" title="go to Fig. 6">6</a>, p. 26).
We cannot tell whether the strait has increased in width during
historical times, for ancient geographers are not very precise in their measurements.
Thus much, however, is certain, that the general features of the strait have not
changed, and the two pillars of Hercules, Calpe and Abyla, may still be recognised
in modern Gibraltar and Ceuta.</p>

<p>The rock of Gibraltar does not form the southernmost promontory of Iberia, but,
being the most striking object along the strait, it has given its name to it. Mariners
look upon it as the true boundary between the Me­di­ter­ra­nean and the Atlantic,
and it has been likened, not inaptly, to a crouching lion guarding the gateway
between the two seas. It rises almost perpendicularly on the east, and the town,
with most of the batteries, has been constructed on the western slope, which is
more accessible. The famous rock, though a natural dependency of Spain, has
become, by right of conquest, one of the great strongholds of
England, and its <span class="xxpn" id="p401">{401}</span>
importance as a fortress as well as a place of commerce is indisputable. In its
caverns have been discovered stone implements and the skeletons of dolichocephalous
men.</p>

<p>The frequent intercourse between Andalusia and the Berber countries on the
other side of the strait is explained by vicinity as well as by similarity of climate.
Algarve, Huelva, and the lower valley of the Guadalquivir, as far as Seville and
Écija, that “stewing-pan” or “furnace” of Spain, form one of the hottest districts
of Europe, and the coast, from Algeciras and Gibraltar to Cartagena, Alicante, and
the Cabo de la Nao, is hardly inferior to it. The country around the Bay of
Cádiz and the hilly districts in the extreme south, which are freely exposed to the
<i>virazon</i>, or sea breeze, enjoy a more temperate climate. In the two torrid coast
regions delineated above frosts are hardly known, and the mean temperature of
the coolest month reaches 54° F. The heat is greatest around the bays exposed
to the full influence of the hot African winds, and least on the Atlantic seaboard,
where westerly breezes moderate it. Contrary atmospheric currents naturally
meet in the Strait of Gibraltar, where the wind is generally high, and tempests
are frequent in winter. Westerly winds prevail during winter, easterly winds
in summer. The two promontories of Europe and Africa are looked upon by
mariners as trustworthy signallers of the weather: when they are wrapped in
clouds or mists rain and easterly winds may be looked for, but when their profiles
stand out clearly against the blue sky it is a sure sign of fine weather and
westerly winds.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn142" id="fnanch142">142</a></p>

<p>The dry and semi-tropical climate of Lower Andalusia frequently exercises a most
depressing influence upon Northern Europeans. In the plain and along the coast
it hardly ever rains during summer, and the heat is sometimes stifling, for the
trade winds of the tropics are unknown. At Cadiz the land wind blowing from
the direction of Medina Sidonia, and hence known as <i>medina</i>, is suffocating, and
quarrels and even murders are said to occur most frequently whilst it lasts. But
the most dreaded wind is the <i>solano</i> or <i>levante</i>, which is hot as the blast from a
furnace. A curious vapour, known as <i>calina</i>, then appears on the southern
horizon, the air is filled with dust, leaves wither, and sometimes birds drop in
their flight as if suffocated.</p>

<p>In the temperate regions of Europe summer is the season of flowers and foliage,
but in Andalusia it is that of aridity and death. Except in gardens and irrigated
fields all vegetation shrivels up and assumes a greyish tint like that of the soil.
But when the equinoctial autumn rains fall in the lowlands, and snows in the
mountains, the plants recover rapidly, and a second spring begins. In February
vegetation is most luxuriant, but after March heat and dryness again become the
order of the day. Indeed, Andalusia suffers from a want of moisture. There are
steppes without water, trees, or human habitations, the most
extensive being on <span class="xxpn" id="p402">{402}</span>
the Lower Genil, where the depressions are occupied by salt lakes, as in Algeria
or Persia, and cultivation is impossible. Another steppe of some extent stretches
to the east of Jaen, and is known as that of Mancha Real. The barren tracts on
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean slopes are relatively even of greater extent than those in the
basin of the Guadalquivir. The volcanic region of the Sierra de Gata is a complete
desert, where castles and towers erected for purposes of defence are the only
buildings. Elsewhere the coast is occupied by saline plains, which support a vegetation
mainly consisting of salsolaceæ, plumbagineæ, and cruciferæ, five per cent.
of the species of which are African. Barilla, the ashes of which are used in the
manufacture of soda, grows plentifully there.</p>

<p>In the popular mind, however, Andalusia has at all times been associated with
fertility. Its name recalls the oranges of Seville, the luxuriant vegetation of the
Vega of Granada, the “Elysian Fields,” and the “Garden of the Hesperides,”
which the ancients identified with the valley of the Bætis. The indigenous flora
entitles Andalusia to its epithet of the “Indies of Spain,” and,
in addition to <span class="xxpn" id="p403">{403}</span>
the tropical plants from Asia and Africa which grow there spontaneously, we meet
with others which have been successfully acclimatized. Dates, bananas, and bamboos
grow side by side with caoutchouc-trees, dragon’s-blood trees, magnolias,
chirimoyas, erythrinas, azedarachs; ricinus and stramonium shoot up into
veritable trees; the cochineal cactus of the Canaries and the ground-nut of the
Senegal do well; sweet potatoes, cotton, and coffee are cultivated with success;
and the sugar-cane succeeds in sheltered places. The coast between Motril and
Málaga is supposed to yield annually £20,000 worth of sugar.</p>

<p>The fauna of Andalusia presents, also, some African features. The molluscs
met with in Morocco exist likewise in Andalusia; the ichneumon may be seen on
the right bank of the Lower Guadalquivir and elsewhere; the chameleon is plentiful;
and a species of wild goat is said to be common to the mountains of Morocco
and the Sierra Nevada. Nor should we forget to state that an African monkey
(<i>Inuus sylvanus)</i> still lives on the rock of Gibraltar, but whether he has been
imported has not yet been determined.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the dawn of European history Andalusia was probably inhabited by an
Iberian race akin to that of the Basques. The Bastulæ, Bastarnæ, and Bastesæ,
in the hills facing the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and the Turdetani and Turduli of the valley
of the Bætis, bore Euskarian names, as did many of their towns. But even thus
early they must have been a mixed race. Celtic tribes held the hills extending
to the north-west of the Bætis, in the direction of Lusitania; the Turdetani,
who were relatively civilised, for they possessed written laws, permitted Phœnicians,
Carthaginians, and Greeks to settle amongst them, and in the end became
thoroughly Latinised. Municipal charters discovered at Málaga, and more recently
at Osuna (<i>Colonia Julia Genitiva</i>), prove that the cities of this province enjoyed a
considerable degree of self-government.</p>

<p>When the Roman world broke down, Southern Spain was
invaded by Vandals, <span class="xxpn" id="p404">{404}</span>
Byzantines, and Visigoths, to whom succeeded Arabs, Berbers, and Jews. The
influence exercised upon the country by the Moors—that is, by a mixed race
of Arabs and Berbers—has been more abiding than that of their Teutonic
predecessors. They maintained themselves for more than seven centuries, were
numerous in the towns, and cultivated the fields conjointly with the ancient
inhabitants of the country. When the order of exile went forth against their
whole race, Moorish blood circulated in the veins of those who were charged with
the execution of this harsh measure. In certain portions of Andalusia, and more
especially in the Alpujarras, where the Moors maintained their independence until
the end of the sixteenth century, the mixture between the two races had made
such progress that religious profession, and not the colour of the skin, decided
nationality. Numerous Arabic words and phrases have found their way into the
Andalusian dialect, and the geographical nomenclature of many districts is Arabic
rather than Iberian or Latin. Most of the large buildings in the towns are <i>alcázars</i>,
or mosques, and even the style of modern structures is Arabic, modified to some
extent by Roman influences. The houses, instead of looking upon the street, face
an interior court, or <i>patio</i>, where the members of the family meet by the side of
a cool fountain. No further ethnical element has been added to the population
since the epoch of the Arabs, for the few German colonists who settled at Carolina,
Carlota, and elsewhere did not prosper, and either returned to their native country
or became merged in the general population.</p>

<p>The Andalusians have frequently been called the Gascons of Spain. They are
generally of graceful and supple build, of seductive manners, and full of eloquence,
but the latter is too frequently wasted upon trifles. Though not devoid of bravery,
the Andalusian is a great boaster, and his vanity often causes him to pass the
bounds of truth. At the same time he is of a contented mind, and does not allow
poverty to affect his spirit. The mountaineers differ in some respects from the
dwellers in the plains. They are more reserved in their manners, and the
<i>Jaetanos</i>, or mountaineers of Jaen, are known as the Galicians of Andalusia.
The beauty of the highland women is of a more severe type, and, compared with
the charming Gaditanes and the fascinating <i>majas</i> of Seville, the women of
Granada, Guadix, and Baza are remarkable for an air of haughty nobleness.</p>

<p>No doubt there are men in Bætica who work, but as a rule love of labour is not
amongst the virtues of the Andalusian. The country might become the great
tropical storehouse of Europe, but its immense resources remain undeveloped. To
some extent this is explained by the fact that nearly the whole country is owned
by great landlords. Many estates, which formerly were carefully cultivated, have
been converted into sheep-walks, and for miles we meet neither houses nor human
beings. The highlands, too, belong to large proprietors, but are leased to small
farmers, who pay one-third of their product in lieu of rent.</p>

<p>The magnificent orange groves of Seville, Sanlúcar, and other towns, the olive
groves, vineyards, and orchards of Málaga, supply the world with vast quantities
of fruit; its productive corn-fields have made Andalusia one of the great granaries
of the world; but it is mainly its wines which enable it to take
a share in <span class="xxpn" id="p405">{405}</span>
international commerce. Immense quantities of the wine known as sherry are grown in
the vineyards of Jerez, to the east of Cádiz. Many of the vineyards belong to
Englishmen, and merchants of that nation are busily occupied in blending and
other operations peculiar to their trade. Several wines, however, maintain their
superior character to the present time. Such are the sweet <i>tintilla</i> of Rota,
<i>manzanilla</i>, and <i>pajarate</i>, made from dried grapes. In spite of many malpractices,
this branch of industry has exercised a most beneficial influence upon the character
of the population. Santa María, on the Bay of Cádiz, is one of the great wine
ports of the world, and Spain has become a formidable rival of its northern
neighbour.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn143" id="fnanch143">143</a></p>

<p>The ancient manufacturing industry of the country can hardly be said to exist
any longer, but mining is still carried on. Strabo exaggerates the mineral
wealth of the country, which is nevertheless very great. Nearly all the productive
mining districts of Southern Spain are in the hills. The Sierra de
Gádor is said to contain “more metal than rock.” Hundreds of argentiferous
lead, copper, and iron mines have been opened there, and in the sierras of
Guadix, Baza, and Almería. Near Linares, on the Upper Guadalquivir, there are
lead mines yielding about 210,000 tons annually. The silver mines of Constantina
and Guadalcanal, in the Sierra Morena, are being worked only at intervals. The
coal basins of Bélmez and Espiel, to the north of Córdova, promise to become of
great importance, although the output at present hardly exceeds 200,000 tons a
year. Deposits of iron and copper exist near them.</p>

<p>But of all the mines of Spain those situated in the province of Huelva are
the most productive. The Silurian rocks there are wonderfully rich in pyrites of
copper. The mines of Rio Tinto strike the beholder by their stupendous extent;
and the existence of ancient galleries, buildings, and inscriptions proves that they
have been worked since the most remote time. The invasion of the Vandals
temporarily put a stop to the work, which was only resumed in 1730. The two
principal deposits have been computed to contain no less than 300,000,000 tons
of ore. The deposits at Tharsis are much less extensive, but within easier reach
of Huelva. They contain 14,000,000 tons of iron and copper pyrites, and are
worked like an open quarry. The deposit is no less than 450 feet in thickness,
and some of the ores yield twenty per cent. of copper. Immense heaps of scoriæ
have accumulated near the mine, where they are bedded in regular strata dating
back to the time of the Carthaginians. The sulphurous vapours rising from
hundreds of furnaces poison the air and destroy the vegetation. The rivers Odiel
and Rio Tinto run with ferruginous water which kills the fish; yellow ochre
is thrown up along their banks; and in their estuary is precipitated a blackish
mud consisting of the metal mixed with the sulphur of decomposed marine
animals.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn144" id="fnanch144">144</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p406">{406}</span></p>

<p>Andalusia, though a desert in comparison with what it might be, rivals Italy
in the fame and beauty of its cities. The names of Granada, Córdova, Seville,
and Cádiz awaken in our mind the most pleasing memories, for these old Moorish
towns have become identified with a great advance in arts and science.</p>

<p>Their advantageous geographical position accounts for their prosperity, past
and present. Córdova and Seville command the fertile plain of the Guadalquivir,
and the roads crossing the gaps of the neighbouring mountains converge upon
them; Granada has its plentiful supply of water and rich
fields; Huelva, Cádiz, <span class="xxpn" id="p407">{407}</span>
Málaga, and Almería are considerable seaports; and Gibraltar occupies a commanding
position between two seas. There are other towns less populous, but of
great strategical importance, as they command the roads joining the valleys of the
Genil and Guadalquivir to the sea.</p>

<p>Amongst the smaller towns which have played a part in history are several to
the east of Granada, such as Velez Rubio and Velez Blanco, on the Me­di­ter­ra­nean
slope; Cullar de Baza, with its subterranean houses excavated in the gypsum, on
the western slope of the <i>Vertientes</i>, or “the water-shed;” Huescar, the heir of an
old Carthaginian city; and Baza, environed by a fertile plain known as <i>Hoya</i>,
or “the hollow.”</p>

<p>Granada, though it celebrates the anniversary of the entrance of Ferdinand
and Isabella, is a very inferior place to what it was as the capital of a Moorish
kingdom, when it had 60,000 houses and 400,000 inhabitants, and was the busiest
and wealthiest town of the peninsula. It is still the sixth city of Spain, but
thousands of its ragged inhabitants live in hideous dens, and close to the picturesque
suburb of Albaicin a mob largely composed of gipsies has settled down in nauseous
caverns. Remains of Moorish buildings are met with only in the suburb named, but
at some distance from the city there still exist edifices which bear witness to the
glorious reign of its ancient masters. The <i>Torres Vermejas</i>, or “red towers,”
occupy a hill to the south; the <i>Generalife</i>, with its delightful gardens, crowns
another hill farther east; and between them rise the bastions and towers of the
<i>Alhambra</i>, or “red palace,” even in its present dilapidated condition one of
the masterpieces of architecture, which has served as a pattern to generations
of artists. From the towers of this magnificent building we enjoy a prospect
which indelibly impresses itself upon the memory. Granada, with its towers,
parks, and villas, lies beneath. The course of the two rivers, Genil and Darro,
can be traced amidst the foliage, whilst naked hills bound the verdant plain
of La Vega, which has been likened to an “emerald enchased in a sapphire.”
The contrast between these savage mountains and the fertile plain, between the
beautiful city and precipitous rocks, struck the Moors with admiration, for they
saw reflected in them their own nature—an outward impassiveness and a hidden
fire. Granada, to them, was the “Queen of Cities,” the “Damascus of the West.”
Nor are the modern Spaniards behind them in their admiration of Granada and
its vicinity.</p>

<p>There are other beautiful towns in the basin of the Genil, but none can compare
with Granada, not even Loja, a “flower in the midst of thorns,” an oasis
surrounded by rugged rocks and savage defiles. Jaen, however, almost rivals
Granada. It, too, was the seat of a powerful Moorish king, the hills surrounding
it are still crowned with the ruins of fortifications buried beneath luxuriant
foliage, and the aspect of the town remains oriental to this day.</p>

<p>The upper valley of the Guadalquivir abounds in cities. Baeza had more than
150,000 inhabitants in the time of the Moors, but wars depopulated it, many of
the people removing to Granada. Close by is Ubeda, another Moorish town.
Higher up in the hills is the mining town of Linares, hardly
large enough to <span class="xxpn" id="p408">{408}</span>
shelter 8,000 residents, but actually inhabited by 40,000. In descending the
river we pass Andújar, famous on account of its <i>alcarrazas</i>, and about twenty miles
below the town of Montoro we reach the marble bridge of Alcolea, celebrated
for the many battles which have been fought for its possession.</p>

<p>Córdova dates back to the dawn of civilisation. It has been famous and
powerful at all times, and the Spanish noblemen are proud of tracing their
origin back to this fountain-head of the “blue blood” (<i>sangre azul</i>) which is supposed
to flow in the veins of Spanish nobles. It was under the Moors that
Córdova reached the apogee of its grandeur; from the ninth century to the close
of the twelfth it had nearly a million of inhabitants; and its twenty-four suburbs
spread far and wide over the plain and along the lateral valleys. The wealth of
its mosques, palaces, and private houses was prodigious; but, more glorious still,
Córdova could boast of being the “nursery of science,” for it was the greatest
university of the world, abounding in schools and libraries. Civil wars, foreign
invasions, and religious fanaticism led to the dispersion of its libraries, and
Córdova can no longer boast of being the first city of Andalusia. Most of the old
monuments have perished, but there still exists the marvellous <i>mezquita</i>, or mosque,
built at the close of the eighth century by Abderrahman and
his son. The <span class="xxpn" id="p409">{409}</span>
interior was fitted up in the most lavish manner, the floors being paved with silver,
and the walls covered with gold, precious stones, ivory, and ebony, but a considerable
portion of the building has been pulled down to make room for a Spanish
cathedral.</p>

<p>The more fertile districts of the province of Córdova are at some distance from
the Guadalquivir, in the hills to the south. Montilla, one of the towns there, is
noted for its wines, as are Aguilar, Baena, Cabra, and Lucena, the latter boasting
likewise of some manufactures. Between Córdova and Seville, a distance of over
ninety miles, following the sinuosities of the river, we do not meet with a single
town of note, for even Palma del Rio, at the mouth of the Genil, is only a small
place, though of some importance as the outlet of Ecija, a large town higher up the
Genil.</p>

<p>Seville, the reigning queen of Andalusia, boasts of a few remarkable buildings,
including the alcazar, a gorgeous cathedral, and the palace known as “Pilate’s
House,” in which the Renaissance is admirably wedded with the Moorish style.
But more famous than either of these is <i>Giralda’s Tower</i>, with the saint’s revolving
statue on the top, like a weathercock. But neither these buildings nor Murillo’s
fine paintings have won Seville its epithet of “Enchantress.” For this it is
indebted to its gaiety and to a succession of fêtes, amongst which bull-fights figure
prominently. Seville became Spanish about the middle of the thirteenth century.
Its citizens valiantly defended their municipal liberties against the King of Castile,
but they were defeated, and most of its inhabitants then fled to Barbary. The
town was repeopled by Christian emigrants. Triana, however, a suburb with
which an iron bridge connects it, is inhabited by gipsies, whose secret tribunal
has its seat there. A short distance to the north of Triana are the ruins of the
amphitheatre of Italica, the old rival of Seville, and the native town of Silius
Italicus, and of the Emperors Trajan, Hadrian, and Theodosius. Coria, another
Roman city, which had its own mint during the Middle Ages, lies below Seville.</p>

<p>Seville has numerous potteries, but its silks and stuffs interwoven with gold
and silver have ceased to command the markets of the world. The largest manufactory
of the place, that of tobacco and cigars, is carried on by Government, and
employs several thousand workmen.</p>

<p>Alcalá de Guadaira, to the south-east of Seville, supplies the latter with bread,
and its delicious springs feed the aqueduct known as Arcos de Carmona, thus
called because it runs parallel with the old Roman road leading to Carmona
(Carmo).</p>

<p>The towns to the south of Seville are no longer of importance. Utrera, the
most considerable amongst them, is a great railway centre, where the line to
the marble quarries of Moron, and that passing through the fertile districts of
Marchena and Osuna, branch off from the Andalusian main line. The town is
well known to <i>aficionados</i>, or sportsmen, on account of the wild bulls which pasture
in the neighbouring <i>marismas</i>. Lebrija, with its fine tower imitated from that of
Giralda, is still nearer to these marshes, which extend almost to the mouth of the
Guadalquivir. <span class="xxpn" id="p410">{410}</span></p>

<p>Sanlúcar de Barrameda, at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, with its white and
pink houses shaded by palms, is not now the great port it was in the time of the
Arabs. It may justly boast of having sent forth, in 1519, the first vessel which
circumnavigated the globe, but it is now rather a pleasure resort than a place of
commerce. Jerez de la Frontera, in the basin of the Guadalete, is the busiest
town between Seville and Cádiz. It is a neat and showy place, surrounded by
immense <i>bodegas</i>, or wine vaults, in which are stored the wines grown in the fertile
valley of Guadalete, and known as sherry. Near Arcos de la Frontera, in the
upper part of the valley, is pointed out the site upon which was fought the famous
battle which delivered Spain to the Mussulmans.</p>

<p>The Bay of Cádiz, so well sheltered against winds and waves by the tongue of
land which begins at the island of Leon, is surrounded by numerous towns,
forming, as it were, but a single city. Rota, on the northern coast of the bay, is
encircled by walls of cyclopean aspect. It is the resort of fishermen, and its
vintners, though reputed Bœotians, produce one of the best wines of Spain.
Farther south, at the mouth of the Guadalete, is the Puerto de Santa María, with
its wine stores, at all times a bustling place. Puerto Real, the <i>Portus Gaditanus</i>,
lies in a labyrinth of brackish channels, and is now merely a landing-place. The
neighbouring dockyard, known as <i>Trocadero</i>, and the arsenal of Carraca, are frequently
inhabited only by galley-slaves and their gaolers. The salt-pans near that
place are most productive.</p>

<p>San Fernando is the most important town on the island of Leon, to the south
of Cádiz. The initial meridian of Spanish mariners is drawn through its observatory.
Looking across the navigable channel of San Pedro, which separates the
island from the main, we perceive the villas of Chiclana, famous as the training-place
of the <i>toreros</i>, or bull-fighters, of Andalusia. Turning to the north, we reach
the narrow ridge of the Arrecife, which may be likened to a stalk with Cádiz as
its expanded flower. Boatmen point out the supposed ruins of a temple of
Hercules, now covered by the sea; and thus much is certain, that the land is at
present subsiding, though this subsidence must have been preceded by an upheaval,
as the peninsula upon which Cádiz has been built rests upon a foundation of shells,
oysters, and molluscs.</p>

<p>We pass several forts, cross the ramparts of the Cortadura, erected in 1811,
and at length find ourselves in the famous city of Cádiz, the heir of the Gadir of
the Phœnicians, called Gadira by the Greeks, and Gades by the Romans. Cádiz
was the leading city of Iberia when that country first became known. Like other
cities, it has known periods of decay, but its great geographical advantages have
always enabled it to recover quickly. It is the natural outlet of an extensive and
fertile region, and its position near the extremity of the continent enables it successfully
to compete with Lisbon for the trade of the New World. Palos may
boast of having sent forth the <i>caravelas</i> which discovered the West Indies, but it
was Cádiz which reaped all the advantages of this discovery, more especially
since the Tribunal of the Indies was transferred to it from Seville (1720). In
1792 Cádiz exported merchandise valued at £2,500,000
sterling to America,
<span class="xxpn" id="p412">{412}</span> and received precious metals and other articles of a value of £7,000,000 in
return. Soon afterwards Spain paid for a commercial monopoly maintained
during three centuries by the sudden loss of her colonies, and Cádiz found itself
dependent upon its fisheries and salt-pans. But recently fortune has again smiled
upon the city, and its harbours are crowded with merchantmen.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn145" id="fnanch145">145</a> Cádiz, with the
towns surrounding its bay, has a population of 200,000 souls. The site of the city
proper is limited by nature, and its houses have been built to a height of five and
six stories. The inhabitants are fond of pleasure, vivacious, and quick at repartee.
They have at all times shown themselves to be good patriots, and it was on the
island of Leon that the Cortes met to protest against the occupation of the country
by the French.</p>

<p>Almería, on the Me­di­ter­ra­nean coast of Andalusia, rivalled Cádiz in importance
as long as it remained in the possession of the Moors, but prosperity fled the place
immediately the Spaniards occupied it. Subsequently the town suffered greatly
from the pirates of Barbary, as is proved by the fortress-like cathedral built in the
sixteenth century. The aspect of the place, with its narrow streets and old <i>kasba</i>,
is quite oriental.</p>

<p>The towns to the west of Almería have a tropical climate and tropical productions.
Dailas, said to be the first permanent settlement of the Arabs, is famous for
its raisins; to it succeed Adra, at the mouth of the Rio Grande of Alpujarra,
Motril, Vélez Málaga, and Málaga, embosomed in gardens watered by the
Guadalmedina.</p>

<p>Málaga, like most of the ports on that coast, is of Phœnician origin, and the
most populous town of Andalusia. Less rich than Granada, Córdova, and
Seville in Moorish monuments, or than Cádiz in historical traditions, it is indebted
to its port and to the fertile country surrounding it for its commercial pre-eminence.
Its exports, consisting of raisins (<i>pasas</i>), almonds, figs, lemons, oranges,
wine, olive oil, &amp;c., are the product of the immediate vicinity. There are foundries,
sugar refineries, and factories. Seen from the sea, the cathedral appears to be
almost as large as the rest of the town, but in the latter must be included not
only the houses standing at the foot of the citadel of Gibralfaro, but also the
numerous villas dotting the surrounding hills. Nay, even the picturesque towns
and watering-places in the neighbouring mountains, such as Alora, Alhaurin,
Carratraca, and Alhama, may be looked upon as dependencies of the city, for
scarcely any but <i>Malagueños</i> resort to them.</p>

<p>Antequera and Ronda, in the interior of the country, belong to the basin of
the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, for the one stands on the Guadalhorce, which enters the sea
near Málaga, whilst the other occupies a position in the upper basin of the
Guadiaro, which washes the foot of the hills of San Roque, to the north of
Gibraltar. Antequera is one of the most ancient towns of Spain, and acts as an
intermediary between Málaga and the valley of the Guadalquivir. On a hill near
it stands a curious dolmen, twenty feet in height, known
as <i>Cueva del Mengal</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p413">{413}</span>
The picturesque Moorish town of Ronda is surrounded on three sides by a gorge
600 feet in depth, 120 to 300 feet wide, and spanned by three bridges, one Roman,
one Arab, and the last (built 1740–88) Spanish. Ronda still possesses some
strategical importance, for it defends the road leading from the valley of the Genil
to that of the Guadiaro. The <i>Rondeños</i> are noted for the skill with which they
train horses for mountain travel. They are notorious smugglers, as
are also many <span class="xxpn" id="p414">{414}</span>
of the inhabitants of the small seaport towns of Marbella, Estepona, and Algeciras,
near Gibraltar.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn146" id="fnanch146">146</a></p>

<p>The rock of Gibraltar, of which the English obtained possession in 1704, has
not only been converted into a first-rate fortress, but is likewise a busy place of commerce.
Gibraltar produces nothing except a little fruit, and most of its provisions,
including meat and corn, are imported from Tangiers, in Morocco. The inhabitants
of the town are dependent for their support upon passing vessels, the English
garrison, and a brisk contraband trade with Spain. Gibraltar affords very indifferent
shelter, and only one-fourth of the vessels passing through the strait call
there, and even these generally confine themselves to replenishing their stock of
coal. Nor is a residence on this picturesque rock very pleasurable, for fevers
prevail, and the military character of the place entails numerous restrictions.
During the heat of summer many of the English residents—facetiously called
“lizards of the rock”—seek refuge at San Roque, a village to the north of the
bay, the neighbourhood of which affords excellent sport.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn147" id="fnanch147">147</a></p>

<p>The spurs from the Sierra Nevada, which approach the coast to the north of
the Cabo de Gata, are separated by <i>ramblas</i>, or torrent beds, and gradually decrease
in height as we proceed north. The torrent of Almanzora separates the Sierra de
los Filabros from its northern continuation, the Sierra de Almenara, which for a
considerable distance runs parallel with the coast. It sends out a spur in the
direction of Cartagena, which terminates in Cabo de Palos. The inland ranges
run almost parallel with this coast range, and are separated by longitudinal valleys
opening out into the great transverse one of the Segura. These ranges are the
Sierra de María, “el Gigante” (4,918 feet), with the Sierra de Espuña (5,190 feet),
the Sierra de Taibilla, the Calar del Mundo (5,440 feet), and
the Sierra de Alcaraz <span class="xxpn" id="p415">{415}</span>
(5,910 feet). The ranges to the north and east of the Segura must be looked upon
as continuations of those mentioned. They attain their greatest altitude in the
Moncabrer (4,543 feet), and their spurs form several notable promontories, amongst
which are the volcanic Peñon de Ifach and the Cabos de la Nao and San António.
Near the latter rises the Mongo (2,337 feet), which has become known as a crucial
trigonometrical station.</p>

<p>The mountains which dominate the valley of the Júcar present the feature of
a denuded plateau, above which rise a few isolated summits. The aspect of the
basin of the Guadalaviar is far more mountainous. On the west it is bounded
by the sierras having their nucleus in the Muela de San Juan (5,280 feet), and to
the east rise the imposing mountain masses of the Javalambre (6,569 feet) and
Peña Golosa (5,942 feet). The summits of the range which extends from the
latter to the great bend of the Lower Ebro, such as the Muela de Ares (4,332 feet),
the Tosal de Encanades (4,565 feet), and Bosch de la Espina (3,868 feet), bear
Catalan names. A range of inferior heights runs parallel with it along the coast,
the interval between the two forming a strath, or vale. This coast range terminates
abruptly in the Sierra de Montsia (2,500 feet), close to the delta of the Ebro,
and before the pent-up waters of the river had excavated themselves a path to the
sea it extended right to the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>All these mountains are for the most part naked, and shrubs appear like black
patches upon their whitish slopes. They stand out clearly against the blue and
limpid sky, whose transparency has won Murcia the title of the “most serene
kingdom.” The climate in the valley of the Segura is even more African in its
character than that of Andalusia. There are only two seasons, summer and
winter, the latter lasting from October to January, but the temperature throughout
the year is equable, owing to the mistral which blows from the cool plateau
and the sea breezes.</p>

<p>The flora, especially along the coast of Murcia, is a mixture of tropical and
temperate plants. There are trees which shed their leaves in winter, others which
retain their foliage throughout the year, and by the side of wheat, rice, maize,
olives, oranges, and grapes are grown cotton, sugar-cane, sweet potatoes, nopals,
agaves, and dates. Tropical diseases have found a congenial soil in this country.
Yellow fever has been imported occasionally from America. The putrefying
substances left upon the fields after floods poison the air, and the brackish waters
of the lagoons, or <i>albuferas</i>, are the breeding-places of fever. The salt lakes to the
south of the Segura, however, exercise no deleterious influence upon the climate.</p>

<p>Nowhere else in Spain is the rainfall so inconsiderable. Between Almería and
Cartagena only eight inches fall during the year; in the environs of Alicante and
Elche the rains are, perhaps, a trifle more copious; and at Murcia and Valencia,
which lie at the foot of mountains that intercept the moisture-laden winds, they
are more abundant still, though even there they do not exceed eighteen inches.
Moreover, most of the rain is immediately absorbed by the thirsty air, and only a
very small quantity finds its way through <i>ramblas</i> to the sea. The quantity is altogether
insufficient for agricultural purposes, and if it were not for
the rivers the <span class="xxpn" id="p416">{416}</span>
country would be a desert. Cultivation is carried on only along the rivers and in a
few other favoured spots. Veritable steppes extend on both banks of the Segura.
The <i>campos</i> between Almería and Villajoyosa, for a distance of 300 miles, are sterile
and bare. The brine and magnesia springs, which rise at the foot of the
saliferous triassic rocks, fill small lakes, which dry up in summer, and in August
the lagoons near Orihuela become covered with a
thick crust of salt.</p>

<p>The beneficent rivers, whose waters are drunk by the <i>huertas</i>, or gardens, near
their banks, are the Segura, Vinalapo, Júcar, Guadalaviar (known as Turia in its
lower course), Mijaros, and several others. They all resemble each other as
regards the ruggedness of their upper valleys and the savageness of the gorges
through which they pass. The Segura forces itself a passage through several
mountain defiles before it reaches the plain of Murcia. The Júcar and Guadalaviar
(Wad-el-Abiad, or “white river”) have fewer obstacles to overcome, but some of
the gorges through which they pass are nevertheless of surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>The volume of these rivers is comparatively small, and the husbandmen dwelling
along their banks economize the water as far as possible. Reservoirs, or
<i>pantanos</i>, have been constructed at the outlet of each valley, whence the water is
distributed over the fields by means of innumerable canals of irrigation. The
irrigated huertas contrast most favourably with the cultivated campos in their
neighbourhood. Irrigation has probably been practised at Valencia since the time
of the Romans, but the Moors appear to have been the first to construct a regular
system of canals. Eight of these, ramifying into innumerable <i>acequias</i>, have
converted the environs of Valencia into an Eden. Carefully manured as they
are, these fields are never allowed to lie fallow. Stalks of maize fifteen and even
twenty-five feet in height may be seen in the gardens, the mulberry-tree yields
three or four harvests annually, four or five crops are obtained from the same
field, whilst the grass is mown as many as nine or ten times. This luxuriant
vegetation, however, is said to be watery, and hence the proverb, “In Valencia
meat is grass, grass is water, men are women, and women nought.”</p>

<p>The huertas of the Júcar, though less famous than those of Valencia, are even
more productive. Orange-trees predominate, and around Alcira and Carcagente
alone 20,000,000 oranges are picked annually, and exported to Marseilles.</p>

<p>The oases in the great steppe which extends from Alcoy to Almería are less
fertile than those on the Júcar and Guadalaviar. That of Alicante is fertilised by
the Castalla, the waters of which are collected in the reservoir of Tibi. The huerta
of Elche, on the Vinalapo, is chiefly occupied by a forest of palm-trees, the
principal wealth of the inhabitants, who export the dates to France, and the leaves
to Italy and the interior of Spain.</p>

<p>The huerta around Orihuela, on the Lower Segura, cannot boast of a palm forest
like that of Elche, but is more productive. The inhabitants of Murcia, higher up on
the same river, though they enjoy similar advantages, have failed to profit by them
to the same extent. Their huerta, which contains a third of the total population
of the province, is fertile, but cannot compare with that of their neighbours. Nor do
the fields of Lorca equal them. They have not yet recovered from the bursting of a
reservoir, the freed waters of which carried destruction as far as Murcia and Orihuela.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The moral and physical character of the inhabitants of a country exhibiting
such great contrasts could hardly fail to present corresponding differences, and,
indeed, we find that the inhabitants of the fertile gardens and those of the barren
steppes and mountains differ essentially, in spite of
their common origin. <span class="xxpn" id="p418">{418}</span></p>

<p>The people of Murcia cannot be said to have issued victoriously from the struggle
against barren rocks, desiccating winds, and a dry atmosphere. They abandon
themselves to a fatalism quite oriental, and make hardly any effort at improvement.
Lazily inclined, they take their siesta in and out of time, and even when awake
preserve an aspect of impassiveness as if they pursued a reverie. They are not
much given to gaiety, and, though neighbours of Andalusia and La Mancha, do
not dance. They are full of rancour and savage hatred when offended, and have
exercised but small influence upon the destinies of Spain. They cannot compare in
industry with Catalans, Navarrese, and Galicians, nor in intelligence with natives
of any other part of Spain. The Valencians, on the other hand, are an industrious
race. They not only cultivate their plains, but scale the barren slopes of the rocks
with their terraced gardens. They are a gay people, famous for their dances.
Ferocious instincts are asserted to underlie this outward gaiety, and a proverb says
that “the paradise of La Huerta is inhabited by demons.” Human
life is held very <span class="xxpn" id="p419">{419}</span>
cheaply in Valencia. Formerly that town supplied the courtiers of Madrid with
hired assassins, and the numerous crosses in and around it are evidence of so many
murders committed in the heat of passion. In Valencia, however, the use of the
knife is a tradition of chivalry, as are duels in some other parts of Europe. The
conscience of the murderer is perfectly at ease; he wipes the blood-stained knife
upon his girdle, and immediately afterwards cuts his bread with it. The dress of
the Valencians consists of loose drawers confined round the waist by a red or violet
scarf, velvet waistcoats with pieces of silver, white linen gaiters leaving the knees
and ankles bare, a bright kerchief wrapped round the shaved head, and a low hat
with brim turned up and ornamented with ribbons. A many-coloured cloak with
a broad fringe completes this costume, and, draped in it, even the meanest beggar
possesses an air of distinction. In their customs and modes of thought the
Valencians differ equally from their neighbours. They speak a Provençal dialect,
mixed with many Arabic words, but more closely related to the language of the
troubadours than the dialect of the Catalans.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the leading pursuit of Valencia and Murcia, and a few branches
of industry are carried on. Many hands are occupied in making the white wines
of Alicante and the red ones of Vinaroz and Benicarló; the grapes of the vineyards
of Denia, Javea, and Gandia, to the north of Cabo de la
Nao, are converted <span class="xxpn" id="p420">{420}</span>
by a complicated process into raisins; and the <i>esparto grass</i> growing abundantly on
the sunny slopes of Albacete and Murcia is employed in the manufacture of mats,
baskets, sandals, and a variety of other objects.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn149" id="fnanch149">149</a> There are hundreds of metalliferous
lodes, but only the lead mines in the hills of Herrerías, to the east of
Cartagena, are being worked on a large scale, and that by foreigners. Zinc has
been worked since 1861, and mines of copper, lead, silver, mercury, and rock-salt
abound at some distance from the coast; but, from want of means of communication,
their exploitation would not pay.</p>

<p>Valencia is the more industrial province of the two. Albacete manufactures
the dreaded <i>navajas</i>, or long knives; Murcia has silk-mills; Cartagena rope-walks
and other establishments connected with shipping; Játiva has a few paper-mills;
but Valencia and Alcoy are now the great centres of industry.
The former <span class="xxpn" id="p421">{421}</span>
manufactures the plaids worn by the peasantry, silks and linens, earthenware and
glazed tiles. Alcoy supplies most of the paper for making
Spanish cigarettes.</p>

<p>The towns of Albacete and Almansa are important, as lying on the great high-road
which connects the plateau of La Mancha with the Me­di­ter­ra­nean seaboard.
But they cannot vie in wealth and population with the towns situated on the coast,
or within twenty-five miles of it. Lorca, the southernmost of these towns, lies
picturesquely on the slopes and at the foot of a hill crowned by a Moorish citadel.
The old town, with narrow tortuous streets and the remains of Arab palaces, has
been given up to Gitanos, and a new town with wide and straight streets built
in the fertile plain irrigated by the Guadalentin. A fine road joins Lorca to the
small harbour of Aguilas, twenty miles to the south.</p>

<p>In descending the valley of the Guadalentin we pass Totana, the head-quarters
of the Gitanos of the country, and Alhama, well known on account of its hot
springs, and finally enter the mulberry and orange groves which surround the
capital of the province. Murcia, though an extensive city, hardly looks like it, for
its streets are deserted, its houses without beauty, and the only objects of interest
are the cathedral, the shady walks along the banks of the Segura, and the canals
irrigating the terrace gardens. Far more interesting is the neighbouring Cartagena,
which was destined by its Punic founders to become a second Carthage
in truth, and its magnificent harbour certainly affords great advantages for commercial
and military purposes. The discovery of the rich lead and silver mines
near the town contributed much towards its prosperity. Successive Spanish
Governments have attempted to restore to Cartagena its ancient strategical importance.
They have constructed docks and arsenals, and erected impregnable
fortifications, but, in spite of this, the population of the town is hardly a third of
what it was in the middle of the eighteenth century. The character of its
commerce is almost local, not­with­stand­ing its excellent port, and esparto grass,
mats, fruits, and ore constitute the leading articles of export.</p>

<p>Alicante, though far less favoured by nature, is a much busier place, thanks to
the fertility of the huertas of Elche, Orihuela, and Alcoy, and the railway which
connects it with Madrid. Only small vessels can approach the quays and piers of
the town, nestling at the foot of a steep rock crowned by a dismantled citadel.
Larger vessels are compelled to anchor in an open roadstead. Other coast towns
of Valencia, such as Denia and Cullera, offer still less shelter, but are nevertheless
much frequented by coasting vessels. Formerly vessels which entered the Bay
of Valencia during winter were bound to exercise the greatest caution, owing to
violent easterly and north-north-easterly winds and fogs, for there existed not
a single port of refuge. This want has now been supplied by the construction
of a port at the mouth of the Guadalaviar, known as El Grao (strand) de Valencia.</p>

<p>Valencia, the fourth city of Spain in population, is the natural centre of the
most fertile huertas. The “City of the Cid” still preserves its crenellated walls,
turrets, gates, narrow and tortuous streets, balconied houses, the windows of which
are shaded by blinds, and awnings spread over the streets to protect passers-by
from the rays of the sun. Amongst its numerous buildings there is but one which
is really curious: this is the <i>Lonja de Seda</i>, or silk exchange, a graceful structure
of the fifteenth century. Gardens constitute the real delight
of Valencia, and <span class="xxpn" id="p423">{423}</span>
the Alameda, which extends along the banks of the Guadalaviar, is, perhaps, the
finest city promenade in Europe. The commerce of Valencia rivals that of Cádiz.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn150" id="fnanch150">150</a></p>

<p>To the north of Valencia the cultivable country along the coast is narrow, and
incapable of supporting large towns. Castellon de la Plana, at the mouth of the
Mijaros, has attained a certain importance, but farther north we only meet with
small places inhabited by fishermen and vine-growers. Formerly the coast road
was defended by castles, chief among which was Saguntum, famous for its glorious
defence against Hannibal. Its site is occupied by the modern town of Murviedro,
<i>i.e.</i> “old walls,” and its ruins are not very imposing.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn151" id="fnanch151">151</a></p>

<p>The Baleares are small in area, but favoured by climate, productiveness, and
natural beauty. They are the “Happy Islands” of the ancients, and, compared
with many of the coast lands, are indeed a favoured region. War and pestilence
have been no strangers to them, but continual troubles have not interfered with
their development.</p>

<p>The islands consist of two groups, the Pityuses and the Baleares proper. The
name of the latter is said to refer to the expertness of the natives as slingers; and,
when Q. Metellus prepared to land upon them, he took care to shelter his men
beneath an awning of hides. The climate is moister and more equable than that
of neighbouring Spain. Violent storms occur frequently.</p>

<p>The structures called <i>talayots</i> (watch-towers) prove that the islands were
inhabited before the historic epoch. These were built probably by the same race
to whom the nuraghi of Sardinia owe their existence; but the present population is
a very mixed one, for every nation of antiquity has
successively invaded the island. <span class="xxpn" id="p425">{425}</span>
The language spoken is a Catalan dialect resembling that of Limousin. The
Majorcans are generally small of stature, but well proportioned, and the women of
some of the districts are famed for their beauty and expressive features. The
peasantry are suspicious and thrifty, but honest and hospitable; and their dress,
consisting of loose breeches, a belt, a bright-coloured vest, and a goatskin cloak, is
picturesque. Dancing to the music of a guitar or flute is their favourite amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>BIZA</b></span> (<span class="smcap">I<b>VIZA</b></span>), the largest island of the Pityuses, is hardly more than fifty miles
from Cabo de la Nao. Its surface is hilly and intersected by numerous torrent beds.
Puerto Magno (Pormany, or Grand Port) lies on the west side, and a similar bay,
the trysting-place of numerous fishing-smacks, on the south side. On its shore
stands the capital of the island, an ancient Carthaginian colony. A chain of islets
and rocks, similar to the Adam’s Bridge of Ceylon, joins the southernmost cape of
Ibiza to Formentera Island. The climate is said to be so salubrious that neither
serpents nor other noxious reptiles can bear it. The population is small, in spite of
the fertility of the island. Watch-towers and castles of refuge near every village
recall the time when the inhabitants suffered from Moorish pirates. The islanders
are happy, for the central Government leaves them pretty much to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M<b>ALLORCA,</b></span> or <span class="smcap">M<b>AJORCA,</b></span> the largest of the group, is the only one which can
boast of a regular range of mountains, rising precipitously along the north-western
coast, and culminating in the twin peaks of Silla de Torrella (4,940 feet) and
Puig Mayor (4,920 feet). These mountains are amongst the most picturesque in
all Europe, and from their summits may be enjoyed a magnificent prospect. The
moufflon is said still to haunt their pine woods and recesses. The greater portion
of the island consists of a plain lying at an elevation of 150 feet above the sea-level,
and dotted over with isolated <i>puigs</i>, or conical peaks, surmounted in many
instances by an old church or castle. The eastern extremity of the island is hilly,
and the Bec de Farruch (1,863 feet) still bears its old Arabic name. Near it are
the wonderful stalactite caverns of Arta, which extend beneath the sea. The
extremities of the most depressed portion of the island open out towards two great
bays, one in the north-east, the other in the south-west. Palma, the capital of the
island, lies on the former of these, though the other, known as Puerto de Alcudia,
would offer greater advantages were it not for the pestilential swamps which
surround it. On the iron-bound northern coast there are no harbours, but coasting
vessels frequent the creek of Soller, whence they export oranges.</p>

<p>The peasants, or <i>pageses</i>, of Majorca have the reputation of being good agriculturists,
but much of the progress made is due to Catalan immigrants. The island
produces delicious wines (Benisalem), olive oil, oranges, vegetables, and pigs, all
of which find a market at Barcelona or in France. The corn grown is not,
however, sufficient for the support of the population, and Majorcans as well as
“Mahonian” gardeners are met with in every town of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. Bay-salt
is made at Cape Salinas. Shoes, cottons, linens, baskets, and porous vases are
produced; but the manufacture of <i>majolica</i> has ceased. Palma is a busy place of
40,000 inhabitants, and its bastioned walls, castle, cathedral, and am­phi­thea­tri­cal­ly
built houses present a fine appearance from the sea. The inhabitants
are proud of <span class="xxpn" id="p426">{426}</span>
their public buildings, and assert that their <i>lonja</i> is superior to that of Valencia.
The <i>Chuctas</i>, or converted Jews, are a curious element of the population. They
occupy a separate quarter, marry amongst themselves, and have preserved their
race distinctions and mercantile genius. A large portion of the landed property
of the island has passed into their hands. A railway traversing the rich districts
of Santa María and Benisalem, to the south of the populous towns of Manacor
and Felanitx, connects Palma with Alcudia.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn152" id="fnanch152">152</a></p>

a height of 1,171 feet. The strong northerly winds which sweep over its plains
cause the trees to turn their branches in the direction of Africa, and orange-trees
find shelter only in the <i>barrancas</i>, or ravines, which intersect them. The climate is
less pleasant than that of the neighbouring island, and the soil less fertile, for,
consisting for the most part of limestone, it rapidly absorbs the rain. There are
two ports and two cities, one at each extremity of the island,
which from time <span class="xxpn" id="p427">{427}</span>
immemorial have claimed precedence. Ciudadela (7,500 inhabitants) enjoys the
advantage of closer proximity to Majorca, but its harbour is bad. Port Mahon
(15,000 inhabitants), on the other hand, possesses an admirable port, and Andreas
Doria says with reference to it that “June, July, and Mahon are the best ports
of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean.” The English made Mahon a wealthy city, but its trade
fell off immediately when they abandoned it in 1802.</p>

<p>Historically and geographically, Aragon and Catalonia form one of the great
natural divisions of Spain, less extensive than the Castiles, but hardly less important,
and far more densely populated.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn153" id="fnanch153">153</a> The political destinies of Aragon and
Catalonia have been the same for more than seven centuries,
but, in spite of this, <span class="xxpn" id="p429">{429}</span>
there exist great contrasts, which have not been without their influence upon the
character of the population. Aragon, a country of plains surrounded by mountains,
is an inland province, and its inhabitants have remained for the most part
herdsmen, agriculturists, and soldiers. Catalonia, on the other hand, possesses an
admirable seaboard. Its natural wealth, joined to favourable geographical position,
has developed commerce with neighbouring countries, and more especially with
Roussillon and Languedoc. Indeed, seven or eight centuries ago, the Catalans
were Provençals rather than Spaniards, and in their language and customs they
were closely related to the people to the north of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>In the course of the great political revolution, the most terrible feature of
which was the war of the Albigenses, Catalonia became a prey to the Castilians.
As long as the Provençal world maintained its natural centre between Arles and
Toulouse, the populations of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean coasts, as far as the Ebro, Valencia,
and the Baleares, were attracted towards it as to their common focus. Those
Christian populations who found themselves placed between Provence on the one
hand and the Arab kingdoms on the other, naturally gravitated towards the
former, with whom they possessed community of race, religion, and language.
Hence the wide range of the idiom known as Limousin, and its flourishing
literature. But when an implacable war had converted several towns of the
Albigenses into deserts; when the barbarians of the North had destroyed the
civilisation of the South, and the southern slopes of the Cévennes had been reduced
by violence to the position of a political dependency of the valley of the Seine,
Catalonia was forced to look elsewhere for natural allies. The centre of gravity
was shifted from the north to the south, from Southern France to the peninsula of
the Pyrenees, and Castile secured what Provence had lost.</p>

<p>The plateau to the south of the Ebro has been cut up, through the erosive
action of rivers, into elongated sierras and isolated <i>muelas</i> (molars), and its edge is
marked by numerous notches, through which these rivers debouch upon the plain.
The Sierra de San Just (4,967 feet), now separated from that of Gúdar by the
upper valley of the Guadalupe, is a remnant of this ancient plateau, as are the
Sierras de Cucalon (4,284 feet), de Vicor, and de la Virgen, which join it to
the superb mass of the Moncayo, in the north-west; and the same applies to the
Sierra de Almenara (4,687 feet), which rises to the west of them.</p>

<p>The granitic mountain mass of the Moncayo (7,705 feet) has offered greater
resistance to the erosive action of the waters than have the cretaceous rocks of the
plateau to the east of it. The Moncayo is the storm-breeder of the plains of
Aragon, and from its summit the Castilian can look down upon the wide valley of
the Ebro. To the Aragonese the plateau is accessible only through the valleys of the
Guadalupe, Martin, and Jiloca, and it is these which have enabled them to obtain
possession of the upland of Teruel, which is of such strategical importance, from
its commanding position between the basins of the Guadalaviar, Júcar, and Tajo.</p>

<p>To the north of the Ebro rises the snow-clad range of the Pyrenees, which
separates Spain from the rest of Europe. Several spurs descend from this master
range into Aragon. But there are also independent ranges, one of
which, that of <span class="xxpn" id="p430">{430}</span>
the Bardenas, rises immediately to the north of the Ebro, right opposite to the
gigantic Moncayo. The parallel ridges of the Castellar and of the “district of the
Five Towns” form a continuation of these hillocks to the east of the Arba, and
then, crossing the valley of the Gallego, we reach the barren terraces of the
Monegros, upon which rises the insular Sierra de Alcubierra, in the very centre
of the ancient lake of Aragon. A saddle, elevated only 1,247 feet above the
sea-level, connects the latter with the mountains of Huesca in the north.</p>

<p>Several mountain masses of considerable height occupy the centre of the
country, and separate these riverine hills from the main range of the Pyrenees.
They consist for the most part of chalk, through which the bounteous rivers
descending from the Pyrenees have excavated their beds. These channels, with
their precipices, defiles, and cascades, form one of the most picturesque mountain
districts of Spain. The most famous of these Pyrenean foot-hills is the Sierra de
la Peña, which is separated from the Pyrenees by the deep valley of the Aragon.
At the eastern extremity of this chain, high above the ancient city of Jaca, rises
the pyramidal sandstone mass of the Peña de Oroel (5,804 feet), from which we
are able to embrace an immense horizon, extending from the Pyrenees to the
Moncayo. The wild district which occupies the centre of this magnificent panorama
is the famous country of Sobrarbe, held in high veneration by patriotic
Spaniards, for it was there they commenced their
struggles against the Moors.</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p431">{431}</span></div>

<p>An elevated saddle connects the Sierra de la Peña with the irregular mountain
mass of the Sierra de Santo Domingo, to the south of it, whose spurs descend in
terraces into the rugged plain of the Five Towns. It is separated by a narrow
cleft, through which passes the Gallego from the Sierra de Guara, which extends
to the river Cinca in the east, and several minor chains run parallel with it. This
parallelism in the mountain ranges may be traced, likewise, as far as the river Segre.</p>

<p>The Monsech, thus called from its arid calcareous ravines, presents the appearance
of an unbroken rampart from the south, but is intersected at right angles by
the gorges of two Nogueras—the Ribagorzana and Pallaresa. The Peña de San
Gervas and the Sierra de Boumort, which rise to the north of it, are much less
regular in their contours, but exceed it in height.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees terminate with the gigantic mountains surrounding the valley of
Andorra, and with the Peak of Carlitte (9,583 feet). The Sierra del Cadi (8,322
feet) belongs to a detached chain hardly inferior to them in height, and culminating
on French soil in the superb pyramid of the Canigou (9,140 feet). Numerous
spurs extend from this sierra towards the sea.</p>

<p>In this rugged mountain region we meet with geological formations of every
age, from the Silurian to the cretaceous. Iron, copper, and even gold abound,
and might be worked with great profit if roads and railways penetrated into the
upper valleys. A coal-field on the Upper Ter, near San Juan de las Abadesas,
is being worked very sluggishly, and others on the western slope of the Cadi
have not even been touched. The famous rocks of salt at Solsona and Cardona lie
at the foot of the Sierra del Cadi, and that of Cardona alone, though it has been
worked for centuries, is estimated to contain nearly 400,000,000 cubic yards.</p>

<p>The abundance of mineral veins is due, perhaps, to the existence of subterranean
lava lakes. The only volcanic hills in the north of Spain are those near
Olot and Santa Pau, in the upper basin of the Fluvia. Immense sheets of basaltic
lava have been ejected there during the tertiary age from fourteen craters, one of
them, upon which stands the old town of Castelfollit, forming a huge rampart of
picturesque aspect. Jets of steam issue even now from many fissures in the
rocks.</p>

<p>The mountains along the coast of Catalonia resemble in every respect those of
Valencia, from which they are separated by the gorge of the Ebro. Near the
mouths of that river the rugged and mountainous region extends about thirty miles
inland, as far as the Llanos del Urgel; but farther north it widens, until it finally
merges in the spurs descending from the Pyrenees. The principal summits are
the Mont Sant (3,513 feet), the Puig de Montagut (2,756 feet), the Monserrat
(4,057 feet), and Monseny (5,276 feet). The best-known passes are at the head
of the Francoli, through which runs the railway from Tarragona to Lérida, the
pass at the head of the Noya, and the Pass of Calaf.</p>

<p>Of the last-named mountains that of Monserrat is the most famous, for
suspended upon one of its flanks hang the remains of the celebrated monastery
in which Loyola deposited his sword. Monserrat has lost its prestige as a holy
place, but still remains one of the most interesting subjects for
the study of <span class="xxpn" id="p432">{432}</span>
geologists. It consists of conglomerate, and has been worn by atmospheric
agencies into innumerable pillars, pinnacles, and earth pyramids surmounted by
huge boulders. Hermitages and the ruins of castles abound, and the prospect
from the highest summit extends from the Pyrenees to the Balearic Isles.</p>

<p>Crossing the valleys of the Llobregat and Ter, we reach the swampy plain of
Ampurdan, an old gulf of the sea, and with it the north-eastern extremity of
Spain, separated from France by the Albères Mountains. The surrounding hills
abound in the remains of ecclesiastical buildings. One of these, near Cabo de
Creus, the easternmost promontory of Spain, and the Aphrodision of the ancients,
marks the site of a temple of Venus.</p>

<p>The basin of the Ebro forms a huge triangle, the mountains of Catalonia being
the base, whilst its apex lies in the hills of Cantabria, close to the Atlantic. The
surrounding hills differ much in height, but the nucleus of all consists of granite,
upon which have been deposited sedimentary strata, the silent witnesses of the
gradual filling up of the old inland lake. The river itself traverses the very centre
of this triangle, at right angles to the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, and only when it reaches the
mountain barrier separating it from the sea does it wind about in search of an outlet.</p>

<p>The Fontibre, or “fountain of the Ebro,” gives birth at once to a considerable
stream, which, fed by the snows of the Peña Labra, rushes with great impetuosity
past Reinosa (2,687 feet), then passes through a succession of defiles, and finally,
having received the Ega and Aragon with the Argo from the north, emerges from
Navarra a great river. Below Tudela (800 feet) it is large enough to feed two
canals, viz. that of Tauste, which carries fertility into the once-sterile tracts at
the foot of Bardenas, and the navigable Imperial Canal, which follows the valley
down to Zaragoza. The ordinary volume of the latter amounts to no less than 494
cubic feet per second, but much of this water is sucked up by the calcareous soil.</p>

<p>The tributary rivers which enter the Ebro in the plains of Aragon compensate
for the loss sustained through canals of irrigation. The Jalon, Huerva, Martin,
and Guadalupe join on the right; the Arba, Gallego, and Segre on the left. This
last is the most important of all, for it drains the whole of the Pyrenean slope
from Mont Perdu to the Carlitte.</p>

<p>The Ebro, after its junction with the Segre, immediately plunges into the
coast ranges of Catalonia, and though the fall thence to the sea amounts to
183 feet in 95 miles, no rapids or cataracts are met with. The suspended matter
brought down by the river has been deposited in the shape of a delta which juts
out fifteen miles into the Me­di­ter­ra­nean, covers an area of 150 square miles, and
abounds in salt marshes, lagoons, and dead river arms. A canal, twenty-two miles
in length, connects the harbour of refuge at Alfaques with the Ebro, but is not
available for ships of great draught, owing to the bar which closes its mouth.
The other embouchures of the river are likewise closed by bars.</p>

<p>The volume of the Ebro<a class="afnanch" href="#fn154" id="fnanch154">154</a> decreases annually, on
account of the increasing <span class="xxpn" id="p433">{433}</span>
quantities of water which it is called upon to furnish for purposes of irrigation,
and sooner or later it will be reduced to the condition of the rivers of Valencia.</p>

<p>The productiveness of the irrigated fields of Aragon and Catalonia bears
witness to the fertility of the soil. Even saline tracts have been converted into
gardens. Tropical plants, agaves, cacti, and a few feathery palms on the coast to
the south of Barcelona recall the beautiful landscapes of Southern Spain. The
valley of the Ebro holds an intermediate position between Murcia and Valencia
and the bleak plateau and mountains of the interior; but water, except in the
immediate neighbourhood of the rivers, is nowhere abundant. On some of the
hill-tops may be seen houses the walls of which are dyed red, because it was found
more economical to mix the mortar with wine than to convey thither water for that
purpose. This deficiency of moisture is a great drawback to certain districts in
the lower valley of the Ebro. The greater portion of Bárdenas, the Monegros, and
the terraces of Calanda are treeless steppes. Cold and heat alternate abruptly,
without reference to seasons, and the climate, in spite of the proximity of the sea, is
quite continental in its character. The hot winds, so much dreaded on the coast
of Catalonia, do not blow from Africa, but from the parched plains of Aragon.</p>

<p>The climate of Catalonia, owing to the breezes blowing from the Me­di­ter­ra­nean,
is far more equable than that of Aragon, and to this circumstance, no less than to
differences of race and greater facilities for commerce, this province is indebted
for its distinct individuality.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn155" id="fnanch155">155</a></p>

<p>Catalonia, being open to invasions from the sea as well as by land, has a much
more mixed population than its neighbour Aragon. On the other hand, a conqueror
once in possession of the latter had but little to fear expulsion at the
hands of new-comers, and the Moors maintained themselves in Aragon three
hundred years after they had been expelled from Barcelona.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the valley of the Ebro are offensively haughty, of sluggish
minds, given to old customs and superstitions, but they are at the same time
singularly persistent, and their bravery does credit to their Celtiberian ancestors.
These fine broad-shouldered men, who follow their donkeys along the high-roads,
the head enveloped in a silken kerchief, and the waist confined by a violet-coloured
belt, are at all times ready for a fight. Up to the close of last century it was
customary to get up fights between villages in mere wantonness, and the <i>rondallas</i>,
a term now employed for open-air concerts, scarcely ever terminated without
bloodshed. In trifles the Aragonese are as stubborn as in matters of importance,
and they are said to “drive in nails with their head.” For several centuries the
Aragonese struggled with the Moors, and the kings, dependent as they were upon
the support of the people, felt constrained to submit to a considerable limitation
of their power. It was Philip II. of Castile who suppressed these ancient provincial
privileges, and condemned Aragon to lead a life of intellectual stagnation.</p>

<p>The Catalans are as self-opinionated as their neighbours the Aragonese; noisy
quarrels frequently take place amongst them; but they
rarely come to blows. They <span class="xxpn" id="p434">{434}</span>
are said to be less firm of character than the Aragonese, yet they succeeded in
maintaining their provincial independence much longer. Few towns have stood
more sieges than Barcelona, and fewer still have offered a more valiant defence.
The Catalans are undoubtedly industrious. They have not only converted the
irrigable valleys facing the sea into gardens, but have likewise attacked the arid
mountains, and, by triturating the rocks and carrying thither soil from the plain,
have made them produce grapes, olives, and corn. Hence the proverb, “A
Catalan can turn stones into bread.” Agriculture, however, does not wholly
supply the wants of so dense a population, and Barcelona with its suburbs has
become a huge manufacturing centre, where cottons, woollens, and other textile
fabrics, hardware, chemical preparations, glass, paper, and various articles are produced.
The province of Barcelona is the chief seat of the cotton industry in Spain,
and fully deserves to be called the Spanish Lancashire.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn156" id="fnanch156">156</a> The Catalans are a
migratory race. They are met with not only in every other province of Spain, but
in all the Spanish colonies. Everywhere they are reputed for their thrift, and in
Cuba are hated as rivals or masters by creoles and blacks.</p>

<p>The towns of Aragon and Catalonia present the same contrasts as do the inhabitants
of the two provinces. Those of the former are of solemn and even gloomy
aspect, whilst the picturesque cities of the maritime province are full of bustle
and mirth. The former represent the Middle Age, the latter our modern era.</p>

<p>Zaragoza (Saragossa) is most favourably situated in the very centre of the plain
of Aragon. It has its Moorish alcázar (the Aljaferia), now used as a barrack;
a curious leaning tower similar to that of Pisa; and fine promenades, including
the Coso and shaded walks. But prouder than of all these attractions are the
inhabitants of the epithet “heroic,” which was bestowed upon their city in consequence
of the valiant resistance it offered in 1808 and 1809, when they not
only defended their homes, but also their patron saint, the Virgen del Pilar.</p>

<p>At Zaragoza a few wide avenues have been cut through the labyrinth of tortuous
streets, but the other towns of the province have preserved their physiognomy
of former days. Jaca, in the upper valley of the Aragon, between the Pyrenees
and the Sierra de la Peña, with its grey houses, still retains its turreted walls and
ancient citadel. It is the old capital of the kingdom of Sobrarbe, but would hardly
be mentioned now if it were not for its position at the foot of the Pass of Canfranc,
and the neighbouring monastery of La Peña. Huesca, at the base of the hills, the
Osca of the Romans, recalls the dominion of the Ausks, or Euskarians. Standing in
the midst of an irrigated plain, it still enjoys a certain importance. It boasts of a
richly decorated cathedral, deserted monasteries, an old royal palace now occupied
by the university, and the remains of a turreted wall. Barbastro, near the river
Cinca, occupies a position similar to that of Huesca. The carriage road over the
Somport connects it with France.</p>

<p>The Arab city of Calatayud, on the river Jalon, is commercially the second
city of Aragon, and replaces Bilbilis of the Iberians,
which stood on a hill near it. <span class="xxpn" id="p435">{435}</span>
One of its most nauseous suburbs is wholly inhabited by mendicants. Teruel, on
the Guadalaviar, the chief town of the Maeztrazgo, with its crenellated walls and
turrets, resembles a mediæval fortress. The Arab tower of its church is one of the
curiosities of “untrodden” Spain, and its aqueduct, which crosses a valley on 140
arches, is a remarkable work of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Several towns of the interior of Catalonia are equally venerable in their aspect.
“Proud” Puigcerda (Puycerda), close to the French frontier, on the Upper Segre,
is hardly more than a collection of hovels surrounded by a rampart. Seo de
Urgel, in a fertile portion of the same valley, is no doubt of some importance as a
fortress, but its streets are dirty, its houses mean, and its mud walls dilapidated.</p>

<p>Still lower down the Segre we meet with the ancient city of Lérida, whose
origin dates back to prehistoric times, and which, owing to its strategical position,
has at all times played a prominent part in military history. The gardens of
Lérida supply much produce for exportation, but the place cannot rise into importance
until the Franco-Spanish coast railway shall have been completed.</p>

<p>Tortosa, a picturesque city just above the delta of the Ebro, and formerly
the capital of an Arab kingdom, commands one of the passages
over the Ebro, <span class="xxpn" id="p436">{436}</span>
and its commerce would increase if the river offered greater facilities for navigation.</p>

<p>Tarragona in the time of the Romans was the great maritime outlet of the
valley of the Ebro. The city was then nearly forty miles in circumference, with
arenas, amphitheatres, palaces, temples, and aqueducts, and a population of hundreds
of thousands. The ruins of this ancient Tarraco have been made use of in
the construction of the modern city, with its clumsy cathedral, towers, decayed
ramparts, and Roman aqueduct intersecting the suburban orange groves. The
manufacturing town of Reus may almost be looked upon as a suburb of it, and is
rapidly increasing in population. Near it is the monastery of Poblet, in which
are deposited the remains of the Kings of Aragon.</p>

<div class="dcaptionsml">BARCELONA, SEEN FROM THE
 CASTLE OF MONJUL.</div></div><!--dctr-->

<p>The country between Tarragona and Barcelona is densely populated. We pass
through the fertile district of El Panadés, the equally fertile valley irrigated by
the reddish waters of the Llobregat, with towns and villages in rapid succession,
until we reach the suburbs of Barcelona. The city proper lies on the sea, at the
foot of the fortifications crowning the steep heights of Monjuich. There is
another citadel of immense size to the east of the city, yet this latter reposes gaily
beneath its batteries, which could easily reduce it to ashes. Barcelona boasts of
being the great pleasure town of Spain. Its population is less than that of
Madrid, but there are more theatres and concert halls. The dramatic performances
are of a superior class, and the taste of the people is more refined. The public
promenades, such as the Rambla, occupying the bed of an
ancient torrent, the <span class="xxpn" id="p437">{437}</span>
sea-walls, and the avenues of trees which separate Barcelona from the citadel and
the suburb of Barceloneta, are crowded on fine evenings. Barcelona is no doubt
the “unique city” of Cervantes, and perhaps “the home of courtesy and of valiant
men;” but we doubt its being the “common centre of all sincere friendships.”
Barcelona exceeds all other towns of Spain by its commerce.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn157" id="fnanch157">157</a> The harbour is
exposed to southerly winds, and somewhat difficult of access. Barcelona is ever
renewing itself. There are broad streets of uniformly built houses, and some
quarters, as that of Barceloneta, on a tongue of land to the east of the port, are
laid out with all the regularity of an American city. The only architectural
monuments of note are a Gothic cathedral and the old palace of the Inquisition.
But all around the town, beyond the suburbs with their factories and workmen’s
dwellings, we meet with numerous villas, occupying delightful nooks in verdant
valleys or the steep hill-slopes. No more charming district exists in Spain than
that to the north of Barcelona and Badalona, extending as far as Masnou, Mataró,
and the river Tordera. Promontories covered with vines, pines, and cork-oaks,
and sometimes crowned by the ruins of a castle, project into the sea; the valleys
are laid out in gardens enclosed with aloe hedges; towns and villages follow in
rapid succession; and the boats and nets of fishermen are seen on the beaches.</p>

<p>Most towns of the province of Barcelona emulate the manufacturing industry
of the capital. Igualada, at the foot of the Monserrat; Sabadell, in a valley,
full of factories; Tarrasa, the old Roman city, near which are the famous baths
of La Puda; Manresa, on the Cardoner rivulet; Vich, the old primatial city of
Catalonia; and Mataró, on the coast, are all distinguished for the manufacture
of cloth, linens, silks, cotton stuffs, ribbons, lace, leather, hats, faience, glass, or
paper. Manufacturing industry has likewise spread into the neighbouring province
of Gerona, and notably to the city of Olot; but the vicinity of the French frontier,
the practice of smuggling, and the presence of large garrisons in the fortresses
of Gerona and Figueras have hindered its development. Gerona has sustained
many a siege, and Figueras, in spite of its huge citadel, has been repeatedly captured.
The walls of Rosas are crumbling to pieces, and every vestige of the Greek city
of Emporion has been buried beneath the alluvium brought down by the river
Fluvia, but it still lives in the name of the surrounding district of Ampurdan.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn158" id="fnanch158">158</a></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The crest of the Pyrenees constitutes for the most part the political boundary
between France and Spain, but there are exceptions to this rule. At the western
extremity of the chain Spain enjoys the advantage, for the valley of the Bidassoa,
on the French slopes, belongs to it; but France is compensated in the east by the
possession of Mount Canigou and the valley of the Upper Segre. As a rule,
however, Spain has the best of the bargain, and this is only natural, as the Pyrenees
are most accessible from the south, and the population
there is more dense. The <span class="xxpn" id="p438">{438}</span>
herdsmen of Aragon and the Basque provinces never missed an opportunity of
taking possession of pastures on the northern slopes of the mountains, and these
encroachments were subsequently ratified by international treaties.</p>

<p>The valley of Aran, in the very heart of the Pyrenees, is one of these bloodless
conquests of Spain. The French Garonne rises in that valley, but the defile
through which it leaves it is very narrow and easily obstructed. Up to the
eighteenth century the Aranese enjoyed virtual independence; and as they are shut
off from the rest of the world by mountains covered with snow during the greater
part of the year, these 21,000 mountaineers would appear to possess more claim to
constitute themselves an independent republic than any other people in Europe.</p>

<p>Farther east there is another mountain valley which, nominally at least, forms
an independent republic. This is Andorra, a territory of 230 square miles, with
6,000 inhabitants. A few pastures on the French slope excepted, the whole of
this valley is drained by the beautiful stream of Embalira, or Valira, which joins
the Segre in the smiling plain of Seo de Urgel. Most of the mountains of
Andorra have been robbed of their trees, and the destruction of the few remaining
forests is still going on. The vegetable soil is being rapidly washed away, and
the moraines of ancient glaciers gradually slide down the mountain slopes.</p>

<p>The republic of Andorra is said to owe its existence to a defeat of the Saracens
by Charlemagne or Louis le Débonnaire, but in reality up to the French Revolution
the valley enjoyed no sovereign rights whatever. It was a barony of the
Counts of Urgel and of Aragon. In 1278 it was decided that Andorra should be
held jointly by the Bishops of Urgel and the Counts of Foix. In 1793 the French
republic declined to receive the customary tribute, and in 1810 the Spanish
Cortes abolished the feudal régime. Andorra thus became an independent state.
The inhabitants, however, continue to govern themselves in accordance with old
feudal customs, which are not at all reconcilable with the principles of modern
republics. The land belongs to a few families. There is a law of entail, and
younger brothers become the servants of the head of the family, whose hospitality
they enjoy only on condition of their working for him. The tithes were only
abolished in 1842. The “liberty” of these mountaineers consists merely in exemption
from the Spanish conscription and impunity in smuggling; and, to increase
their revenues, they have recently established a gambling-table. Their legitimate
business consists in cattle-breeding, and there are a few forges and a woollen factory.</p>

<p>The republic of Andorra recognises two suzerains, viz. the Bishop of Urgel,
who receives an annual tribute of £25, and the French Government, to whom
double that sum is paid. Spain and France are represented by two provosts, the
commandant of Seo de Urgel exercising the functions of viceroy. The provosts
command the militia and appoint the bailiffs, or judges. They, together with a
judge of appeal, alternately appointed by France and Spain, and two <i>rahonadores</i>,
or defenders of Andorran privileges, form the Cortes. Each parish is governed by
a consul, a vice-consul, and twelve councillors elected by the heads of families. A
General Council, of which the consuls and delegates of the parishes are members,
meets at the village of Andorra. But in spite of these fictions
Andorra is an <span class="xxpn" id="p439">{439}</span>
integral part of Spain, and the carabineers never hesitate to cross the frontiers of
this sham republic. By language, manners, and customs the Andorrans are
Catalans. Exemption from war has enabled them to grow comparatively rich.
They are intelligent and cunning, and well know how to assume an air of astonishment
when their interests are at stake. Acting the fool, in order to take some
one in or avoid being ensnared, is called by their neighbours “playing the
Andorran.” Andorra, a neat village, is the capital of the territory, but San Julia
de Loria is the most important place, and the head-quarters of the smugglers.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The
Basque provinces (Vascongadas) and the ancient kingdom of Navarra, though
scarcely a thirtieth part of Spain, constitute a separate region, not only on account
of geographical position, but also because they are inhabited for the most part by
a distinct race, having its own language, manners, and political institutions.</p>

<p>Looked at from a commanding position, the hills connecting the Pyrenees
with the Castilian plateau resemble a sea lashed by contrary winds, for there are no
prominent mountain ranges. Even the Pyrenees have sunk down to a mean height
of 3,000 feet, and the Lohihulz (3,973 feet), where they cease to form the frontier,
scarcely deserves to be called a mountain. They extend thence to the Pass of
Azpiroz (1,860 feet), where they terminate. The vague range beyond is known as
Sierra de Aralar (4,330 feet), and still farther west by a variety of local names.
These mountains are traversed by several low passes, facilitating communication
with the valley of the Ebro, the most important of which is the Pass of Orduña
(2,134 feet), which is crossed by the railway from Bilbao to Miranda, and dominated
by the Peña Gorbea (5,042 feet) and the Sierra Salvada (4,120 feet).</p>

<p>The spurs which descend from these mountains towards the Bay of Biscay are
likewise very irregular in their features. Most of them are connected by transversal
chains, through which the rivers have only with difficulty forced for themselves
an outlet towards the sea. The Bidassoa, for instance, sweeps far to the
south, through the valley of Bastan, before it takes its course to the northward, in
the direction of its estuary at Fuenterrabia. Within its huge bend it encloses a
detached portion of the Pyrenees, the principal summit of which is the famous
Mont La Rhune (2,954 feet), on the French frontier. Equally isolated is the
Jaizquibel (1,912 feet), which rises from the plains of Irun, close to the mouth of
the Bidassoa, and from whose summit there is a view of incomparable beauty.
It terminates in Cape Higuer, or Figuer, the northernmost point of Cantabria.</p>

<p>The maritime slope of the Basque countries presents a great variety of geological
formations, including Jurassic limestones and chalk, granites and porphyries.
The mineral resources are immense; copper and lead abound, but the great wealth
consists in iron. The mines of Mondragon, in Guipúzcoa, have long been famous,
but the most productive mining district is Somorrostro,
to the west of Bilbao. <span class="xxpn" id="p440">{440}</span></p>

<p>The sierras of Aragon running parallel with the Pyrenees extend also
into Navarra and the Vascongadas, and are frequently connected with the
main range by lateral branches. To the west of Pamplona they spread
out into a rugged plateau, surmounted by the Sierra de Andía (4,769
feet), the labyrinthine ramifications of which occupy the district of
Amezcuas, a region offering great advantages to partisan warfare. The
southern chain, not so well defined, bounds the Carrascal, or “country
of evergreen oaks,” in the south. This region, too, has frequently been
the scene of civil war. Farther west the famous defile of Pancorbo
leads through the Montes <span class="xxpn" id="p441">{441}</span>
Obarenes (4,150 feet) to the plateau of Castile. The saddle of
Alsásua (1,955 feet), over which passes the railway from Vitoria (1,684
feet) to Pamplona (1,378 feet), connects the Pyrenees with the Sierra
de Andía, whilst as to the mountains of the province of Logroño, they
are spurs of the mountain masses forming the northern edge of that
plateau, viz. the Sierra de la Demanda in the west, and the Sierra
de Cebollera in the east, the latter giving birth to the Sierras de
Camero.</p>

<p>Several of the mountain districts are quite Castilian in their
asperity and nakedness, for the forests have been cut down to feed the
iron furnaces. In Southern Navarra we meet with veritable deserts.
But in the Basque countries and Western Navarra, where it rains
copiously, the hills are clad with forests, the valleys with turf, and
rivulets wind amongst groves of elder-trees. Naked precipices of sand
or limestone contrast well with this verdure, from which peep out the
small white houses of villages embosomed in orchards, and scattered in
the valleys and hill-sides.</p>

<p>Moist north-westerly winds are frequent in the Bay of Biscay, and account for
the equable temperature of the country. It rains abundantly, and in all seasons.
The climate resembles that of Ireland, and, though damp, it is healthy and most
conducive to the growth of vegetation. The country is rich in corn, wine, oil,
and cattle; the northern slopes are covered with fruit trees of every kind, and
<i>zagardua</i>, or cider, is a favourite drink; and in the more remote valleys of the
Pyrenees we meet with some of the most magnificent forests in Spain. That of Val
Cárlos (valley of Charlemagne), near the famous Pass of Roncevaux, or Roncesvalles,
though none of the largest, is reputed for its beauty
and legendary associations. <span class="xxpn" id="p442">{442}</span></p>

<p>Who are the Basques, whose bravery is traditional? What is their origin?
What their relationship to the other peoples of Europe? All these questions it is
impossible to answer. The Basques are a mysterious race, and can claim kinship
with no other nation. It is not even certain whether all those who pass by that
name are of the same race. There is no typical Basque. No doubt most of the
inhabitants of the country are distinguished by finely chiselled features, bright
and firm eyes, and well-poised bodies, but the differences in stature, form of skull,
and features are very considerable. Between Basque and Basque the differences
are as great as between Spaniards, Frenchmen, and Italians. There are tall men
and short, brown and fair, long skulls and broad, and almost every district has its
distinct type. The solution of this problem is daily becoming more difficult, for,
owing to a continual intermixture with their neighbours, the original type, if there
really existed one, is gradually being obliterated. It is possible that at some remote
time the remnants of various races occupied this country, and adopted the language
of the most civilised among them. Instances of this kind abound in every people.</p>

<p>Leaving out of sight the differences existing between the Basques of Spain and
those of French Navarra, the Basques may be described as having broad foreheads,
straight noses, finely shaped mouths and chins, and well-proportioned figures.
Their features are exceedingly mobile, and every sentiment is reflected upon them
by a lighting up of the eyes, a movement of the eyebrows, or a trembling of the
lips. The women especially are distinguished by the purity of their features; their
large eyes, smiling lips, and small waists are universally admired. Even in the
towns, where the race is least pure, most of them are strikingly beautiful and full
of grace. There are districts where obesity is a veritable phenomenon. Men and
women carry themselves nobly; they are polite to strangers, but always dignified.</p>

<p>The Basques call themselves Euskaldunac, or Euskarians, and their language
Euskara, or Eskuara. The exact meaning of these terms is not known, but in all
probability it is “speech.” This speech of the Basques differs in its words and
structure from every other language of the world; but many words have been
borrowed from neighbouring languages. Everything with which they became
acquainted through foreigners, all ideas imported since prehistoric times, are
designated by words not forming part of the original stock of the language. Even
the names of domestic animals and metals are of foreign origin. The language
may, perhaps, be classed with the polysynthetic languages of the American
Indians, or with the agglutinant idioms of the Altai, and belongs, consequently, to
the most remote period of human history. As to the Basques themselves, they
declare their speech to be superior to every other, and according to some it was
in Euskara that man first saluted the sun.</p>

<p>For the present we are compelled to look upon the Basques as the last
remnant of an ancient race. There are not wanting proofs that the Euskaldunac
formerly occupied a far wider territory. No monuments, no inscriptions, nor even
legends give a clue to this; but we find it, after thousands of years, in the names of
mountains, rivers, and towns. Euskarian names abound in the Pyrenean valleys
of Aran, Bastan, Andorra, and Querol, and in the plain to the
north of them. <span class="xxpn" id="p443">{443}</span></p>

<p>Most writers on Spain identify these Euskarians with the Iberians of the
ancients, and they have been credited with being the authors of various inscriptions
upon coins written in unknown characters which have been discovered in Spain
and Southern France, and which M. Boudard has shown to be really in Euskarian.
They must thus have occupied the whole of the peninsula and Southern France,
and even in Africa traces of their presence
have been discovered. <span class="xxpn" id="p444">{444}</span></p>

<p>The extent of territory occupied by Basque-speaking populations in the time
of the Romans is not known, but probably it was not any greater than it is
now, for the Euskarians have ever since maintained their independence, and
nothing compelled them to adopt the language of their despised neighbours.
Bilbao has almost become Spanish, as have also the towns in the plain of Álava.
Pampeluna, the Irun of the Iberians, is Euskarian merely by historical tradition,
whilst farther east Basque is only spoken in the upper valleys of Roncevaux,
Orbaiceta, Ochagavia, and Roncal. The Peak of Anie marks the extreme limit of
Basque on both slopes of the Pyrenees. Out of four Euskarian provinces there is
only one—viz. Guipúzcoa—where Basque predominates; but even in that province
the inhabitants of the cities of St. Sebastian and Irun speak Castilian. In the south
of Navarra and of the so-called Basque provinces the inhabitants have spoken a Latin
dialect from time immemorial. Spanish and French are slowly but surely superseding
the Basque, and the time when it will be a thing of the past is not very distant.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn160" id="fnanch160">160</a></p>

<p>Strabo speaks of the Cantabrians, the direct ancestors of the Basques, with an
admiration akin to horror. Their bravery, love of freedom, and contempt of life he
looked upon as superhuman qualities. In their wars against the Romans they killed
each other to escape captivity, mothers strangled their children to spare them the
indignities of slavery, and prisoners nailed to the cross burst into a chant of victory.
The Basques have never been wanting in courage. History shows that they were
superior to the surrounding nations in uprightness, generosity, love of independence,
and respect for personal liberty. The serfs of the neighbouring provinces looked
upon them as nobles, for in their abject condition they fancied that personal liberty
was a privilege of nobility. This equality, however, existed only in Guipúzcoa and
Biscay, whilst in Álava and Navarra, where the Moors gained a footing, and Castilian
influences made themselves felt later on, there originated a feudal nobility, with
its usual train of vassals and serfs. However, all the provinces have jealously
watched over their local privileges. At a period when European history was
one continual series of wars, the Basques lived in peace. Their small commonwealths
were united into a fraternal confederation, and enabled to resist invaders.
They were bound to sacrifice life and property in the defence of their common
fatherland, and their standards were emblazoned with three hands joined, and
the motto, <i>Irurak bat</i>, <i>i.e.</i> “The three (provinces) are but one.”</p>

<p>Nothing exhibits more strikingly the comparative civilisation of these Euskarians
than their respect for personal liberty. The house of a Basque was
inviolable, and he could not be deprived of his horse or his arms. At their
national meetings all voted, and in some of the valleys even the women were
permitted to take part in the discussions. It was not, however, customary for the
women to sit down at the same table with the <i>etcheco-jauna</i>, or master of the
house, and his sons; they took their meals separately by the side of the hearth.
This old custom is still observed in country districts; and so strong is the force
of tradition, that the wife would almost consider it a disgrace
to be seen sitting by <span class="xxpn" id="p445">{445}</span>
the side of her husband on any other occasion than her wedding-day. On fête-days
the women keep apart; they dance amongst themselves, allowing the men
to engage in ruder sports. If a nation may be judged from its pastimes, the
Basques deserve to rank high in our estimation. They are fond of athletic sports,
and mysteries and pastoral pieces are still performed in the open air.</p>

<p>But the Basques have their faults. Anxious to retain their ancient privileges,
or <i>fueros</i>, they have become the champions of despotism. These fueros date from
1332, when deputies from the provinces went to Burgos, and offered the title of
Lord to Alfonso the Judge, King of Castile. In accordance with
the treaty then <span class="xxpn" id="p446">{446}</span>
concluded, the sovereign is prohibited from possessing any fortress, village, or
even house within the territory of the Euskarians. The Basques are exempt from
the conscription, and their militiamen, or <i>miqueletes</i>, remain within the provinces
except in time of war. The taxes can only be levied with the consent of the provincial
juntas, and must be expended within the provinces, except what may be
granted as a “gift.” Commerce is not subjected to the same restrictions as in the
rest of Spain, and there are no monopolies. The municipalities enjoy absolute self-government,
carried on by an alcalde, an <i>ayuntamiento</i>, or town council, and <i>parientes
mayores</i>, or elders. In appearance this organization is quite democratic, but in
reality there exist many feudal usages. In some places the town councils are self-elected;
in others they are elected by persons paying a specified amount in taxes,
or by nobles of a certain category; in others, again, they are appointed by the lord
of the manor. The provincial juntas are elected in most diverse ways. The
franchise, far from being universal, is a privilege, and its exercise is attended with
puerile formalities. The laws of precedence are rigidly adhered to.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the exceptional position of the Basque provinces cannot
be maintained. Navarra was assimilated with the rest of Spain in 1839, and this
process is progressing irresistibly in the other provinces. If the descendants of the
Euskarians decline to share free institutions with the rest of Spain, they can never
maintain them on their own behalf. Twice already have they been defeated on an
appeal to arms; but more powerful than war is the influence exercised by industry,
commerce, and increased facilities for in­ter­com­mu­ni­ca­tion. This fusion is being
hastened by emigration and migration, for the Basques not only seek work during
winter in the more hospitable lowland districts, but they also emigrate in thousands.
They are very clannish, and at Madrid and elsewhere have founded “Patriotic
Societies,” but in spite of these they soon become merged with the rest of the
population. The few towns are principally inhabited by strangers, for the Basques
prefer a country life. Their homesteads are scattered over hill-slopes and through
the valleys, and beneath the oaks in front of them the inmates meet after the
day’s labour to pass their time in music and dancing.</p>

<p>Bilbao, the largest town of the Basque provinces, has at all times proved a
rival of Valencia, Santander, and Cádiz. Its exports consist principally of iron
ores from neighbouring mines. Most of its inhabitants are Spaniards, and during
the Carlist wars the environs of the town were frequently stained with blood. It
was under its walls that Zumalacarreguy, the Carlist leader, received his deadly
wound. The river Nervion connects Bilbao with its harbour at Portugalete.</p>

<p>St. Sebastian, the largest city of Guipúzcoa, is likewise Spanish. A seaport
and fortress defended by a Castilian garrison, it resembles in aspect and language
the towns of the interior of the peninsula. Monte Orgullo (475 feet), crowned by
the Castle de la Mota, and bristling with fortifications; the beautiful Bay of La
Concha, to the west of the town, with its fine beach; the river Urumea, which
flows to the east of the citadel, and struggles at its mouth with the foam of the
sea; shady walks and an amphitheatre of verdant hills dotted with villages, render
St. Sebastian a delightful spot, the favourite resort
of worn-out and idle <span class="xxpn" id="p447">{447}</span>
cosmopolitans. The town itself is devoid of interest, for since its destruction by the
English in 1813 it has been rebuilt with monotonous regularity. Its harbour,
though frequented by coasting vessels, is shallow and insecure. The magnificent
Bay of Pasages, to the east of the town, might have been converted into a splendid
harbour, but its great advantages have never been appreciated, and its mouth
is now closed by a bar of alluvium brought down by the Oyarzun.</p>

<p>Delightful Fuenterrabia (Fontarabie), with its escutcheoned houses, is likewise
shut off from the sea by a bar, and is indebted for such importance as it possesses
to its sea baths and the vicinity of France, which is visible from its battered
walls. Irun, the terminal station of the Spanish railways, close to the French
frontier, is an important strategical position; and Tolosa, with its factories, is the
capital of Guipúzcoa. Zarauz, Guetaria (on the neck of a peninsula), and Lequeitio
are seaside resorts. Zumaya, at the mouth of the Urola valley, has quarries of
gypsum, which furnish excellent cement. Near Vergara are ferruginous springs,
and a famous college founded in 1776 by the Basque Society. The convention
which put a stop to the first Carlist war in 1839 was signed here. Durango, likewise,
has frequently been mentioned in connection with the civil wars carried on
in the north of Spain. Guernica, in Biscay, boasts of a palace of justice and an
old oak beneath which the legislature is in the habit of meeting; but, like all
other Basque towns, it is hardly more than a village.</p>

<p>The centres of population are not more numerous on the southern slope of the
Pyrenees. Vitoria, the capital of Álava, on the railway connecting Madrid with
Paris, is a commercial and manufacturing town. Pamplona, or Pampeluna, recalls
the name of Pompey, who rebuilt it. It is a fortress, often besieged and captured.
Its cathedral is one of the finest in Spain. Tafalla, <i>la flor de Navarra</i>, the ancient
capital of the kingdom, has the ruins of a palace, which Carlos
the Noble, who <span class="xxpn" id="p448">{448}</span>
built it, desired to unite by means of a covered gallery with the palace of Olite,
three miles lower down in the same valley. Puente la Reina is celebrated for its
wines. Estella, one of the most charming towns of Navarra, commands several roads
leading to Castile and Aragon, and its strategical importance is consequently considerable.
The Carlists, during the late war, transformed it into a formidable fortress.</p>

<p>Tudela, abounding in wines, Calahorra, and Logroño, all in
the adjoining province of Logroño, are likewise of some
value from a military point of view, for they command the
passages over the Ebro. Calahorra, with its proud motto,
“I have prevailed over Carthage and Rome,” was the great
bulwark of defence when Sertorius fought Pompey, but was
made to pay dearly for its heroism. Besieged by the Romans,
its defenders, constrained by hunger, fed upon their women
and children, and most of them perished. Though situated in
the fertile district of Rioja, beyond the frontiers of the
Euskarian language, the history of Calahorra is intimately
connected with that of the Basque provinces, for upon its
ancient laws were modelled the fueros of Álava.<a

<p class="pfirst">The
Atlantic slope of the Cantabrian Pyrenees is a region completely distinct from
the rest of Spain. Mountains, hills, valleys, and running waters succeed each other
in infinite variety, and the coast throughout is steep, with bold promontories and
deep inlets, into which flow rapid torrents. The climate is moist and salubrious.
The Celto-Iberian inhabitants of the country have in most instances escaped the
commotions which devastated the other provinces of the peninsula, and the population,
in proportion to the cultivable area, is more dense than elsewhere. This
region, being very narrow compared with its length, has been split up into several
political divisions, in spite of similarity of physical features. The old kingdom
of Galicia occupies the west, the Asturias the centre, and Santander the east.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn162" id="fnanch162">162</a></p>

<p>The mountain region of Santander begins immediately to the east of the
Sierra Salvada and the depression known as Valle de Mena. The Cantabrian
Mountains slope down steeply there towards the Bay of Biscay, whilst their
height above the upland, through which the Ebro has excavated its bed, is but
trifling. The Puerto del Escudo attains an elevation of 3,241 feet above Santander,
its southern descent to the valley of the Virga hardly exceeding 500 feet. The Pass
of Reinosa (2,778 feet), farther west, through which runs the railway from Madrid
to Santander, is even more characteristic. An almost imperceptible height of
land there separates the plateau from the steep declivity which leads down to the
coast, and by means of a canal sixty feet deep, and a mile in length, the waters
of the Ebro might be diverted into the river Besaya, which enters the Atlantic
at San Martin de Suances. This height of land forms
the natural outlet of <span class="xxpn" id="p449">{449}</span>
the Castiles to the sea, and its possession is as important to the inhabitants of the
plateau as is that of the mouth of a river to a people dwelling on its upper course.</p>

<p>Immediately to the east of this pass the aspect of the mountains changes. They
rise to a great height, piercing the zone of perennial snow, and their southern
escarpments are of great steepness. The Peña Labra (8,295 feet) dominates the
first of these mountain masses. Rivers descend from it in all directions: the Ebro
in the east, the Pisuerga in the south, and the Nansa, or Tinamenor, in the north-west.
Farther west the Peña Prieta rises to a height of 8,295 feet, its snows
feeding the Carrion and Esla. It is joined in the north to a mountain mass even
more considerable, which bears the curious name of Peñas de
Europa, or “rocks <span class="xxpn" id="p450">{450}</span>
of Europe,” and culminates in the Torre de Cerredo (8,784 feet), covered with
snow throughout the year, and boasting even of a few glaciers, due to the excessive
amount of precipitation.</p>

<p>The valley of La Liébana, at the eastern foot of the Peñas de Europa, resembles
a vast caldron of extraordinary depth. Shut in on the west, south, and east by
huge precipices rising to a height of 6,500 feet, it is closed in on the north by a
transversal chain, through which the waters of the Liébana have excavated for
themselves a narrow passage. The village of Potes, in the centre of this valley,
lies at an elevation of only 981 feet above the level of the sea. In Santander and
the Asturias, even more frequently than in the Basque country, we meet with
secondary chains running parallel with the coast. These are composed of triassic,
Jurassic, and cretaceous rocks, and rise like advanced walls of defence in front of
the main range of the mountains, which consist of Silurian slates upheaved by
granite. It results from this that the course of the rivers is most erratic. On
leaving their upper valleys, where they frequently form cascades, their farther
progress is arrested by these parallel ranges, and they twist about to the east and
west until they find an outlet through which they may escape.</p>

<p>The two funnel-shaped valleys of Valdeon (1,529 feet) and Sajambre
are enclosed between spurs of the Peñas de Europa. Their torrents drain
into the Bay of Biscay, but they are most readily accessible from the
plateau. Farther west the mountains decrease in height, and their main
crest gradually recedes from the coast. They are crossed here by the
Pass of Pajares (4,471 feet), which connects Leon with Oviedo. <span
class="xxpn" id="p451">{451}</span></p>

<p>The Asturian Mountains are objects of veneration to every patriotic Spaniard.
Beautiful as they are, their lower slopes being covered with chestnut-trees, walnut-trees,
and oaks, whilst higher up forests of beeches and hazel alternate with
meadows, their beauty is enhanced by the fact of their having afforded a refuge to
the Christians whilst the Moors held the rest of the country. Mount Ansena
sheltered St. Pelagius and his flock, and at Covadonga he built himself an abbey.
These “illustrious mountains” do not, however, merely boast of historical associations,
delightful villages, herds, and pastures; they hide within their bowels a rich
store of coal, one of the principal sources of wealth to the Asturias.</p>

<p>Galicia is separated from the Castilian plateau by a continuation of the Cantabrian
Pyrenees, which here swerve to the south, and through which the Sil has
excavated its bed. To the north of that river they culminate in the Pico de
Miravalles (6,362 feet), and are crossed by the Pass of Predrafita (3,600 feet),
through which runs the main road from Leon to Galicia.</p>

<p>In Galicia the hills rarely form well-defined chains, and
mostly consist of <span class="xxpn" id="p452">{452}</span>
primitive rocks or small table-lands, with peaks or summits rising a few hundred
feet above the general level of the country. The disposition of the small ranges
generally corresponds with that of the coast. The Sierra de Rañadoiro (3,612 feet),
a spur of the Cantabrian Mountains, forms the natural
boundary between the <span class="xxpn" id="p453">{453}</span>
Asturias and Galicia. West of it, the Sierra de Meira (2,982 feet) runs in the same
direction, but the chains which terminate in Capes Estaca de Vares and Ortegal
(<i>i.e.</i> Nortegal, “north cape”) run from east to west, and are dominated by the
pyramid of Monte Cuadramon (3,342 feet). The hills to the west of the river Miño
(Minho) terminate in the famous promontories of Toriñana and Finisterre, or
“land’s-end.” This latter, a steep cliff rising boldly above the waters to the west
of the wide Bay of Corcubion, formerly bore a temple of the ancient gods, since
replaced by a church dedicated to the Virgin.</p>

<p>The coast of the Asturias abounds in small bays, or <i>rias</i>, bounded by steep cliffs.
In Galicia these rias assume vast proportions, and are of great depth. They may
fitly be likened to the fiords of Northern Europe, and their origin appears to be
the same. The marine fauna of these Galician rias is Britannic rather than Lusitanian,
for amongst two hundred species of testacea collected by Mr. MacAndrew
there are only twenty-five which were not also found on the coasts of Britain.
Moreover, the flora of the Asturian Mountains is very much like that of Ireland;
and these facts go far in support of the hypothesis, started by Forbes, that the
Azores, Ireland, and Galicia, anterior to the glacial epoch, were connected by land.</p>

<p>The climate, too, resembles that of Great Britain. The rainfall on the exterior
slopes of the mountains is abundant, whilst to the south of them, in the arid plains
of Leon and Castile, it hardly rains at all. There are localities in the Asturias
where the rainfall amounts to more than six feet annually, a quantity only again
met with on the western mountain slopes of Scotland and Norway, and on the
southern declivities of the Swiss Alps. There is no season
without rain, and <span class="xxpn" id="p455">{455}</span>
droughts are exceedingly rare. Equinoctial storms are frequent in autumn, and
render the Bay of Biscay dangerous to mariners. The temperature is equable,
and fogs, locally known as <i>bretimas</i>, are as frequent as in the British Islands.
These fogs exercise a strong influence upon the superstitious minds of the Galicians,
who fancy they see magicians, or <i>nuveiros</i>, ride upon the clouds, expand into mists,
and shrink back into cloudlets. They also believe that the bodies of the dead are
conveyed by the mists from cemetery to cemetery, these fearful nocturnal processions
being known to them as <i>estadeas</i>, or <i>estadhinas</i>.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn163" id="fnanch163">163</a></p>

<p>In spite of an abundance of running water, the Cantabrian provinces cannot
boast of a single navigable river. In the Asturias the littoral zone is too narrow,
and the slope too considerable, to admit of torrents becoming tranquil rivers. Nor
are the Tambre and Ulla, in Galicia, of any importance; and the only true river of
the country is the Miño, called Minho by the Portuguese on its lower course, where
it forms the boundary between the two states of Iberia. The Miño is fed from
both slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains, the Miño proper rising on the western
slope, whilst the Sil comes from the interior of the country. The latter is the
main branch. “The Miño has the reputation,” say the Spaniards, “but the Sil
has the water.” The Sil, before leaving the province of Leon, passes through the
ancient lake basin of the Vierzo, now shrunk to a small sheet of water known as
the Lago de Carrocedo. It then passes in succession through a wild gorge, a
second lake basin, the tunnel of Monte Furado (“pierced mountains”), excavated by
the Romans to facilitate their mining operations, and finally rushes through a
gorge intersecting the Cantabrian Mountains, and one of the wildest in all Spain,
with precipitous walls more than 1,000 feet in height. Immediately below the
confluence with the Miño a second gorge has to be passed, but then the waters of
the river expand, and flow into the sea through a wide estuary. Below Tuy, for a
distance of about twenty miles, the river is navigable. But though of small service
to navigation, the Miño is nevertheless one of the eight great rivers of the Iberian
peninsula, and proportionately to the extent of its basin it is the most copious.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn164" id="fnanch164">164</a></p>

<p>The water of this and other rivers is not needed for agricultural purposes, for it
rains abundantly in Galicia and the Asturias, and the emerald meadows of these
provinces are as famous as those of England. The flora,
however, is upon the <span class="xxpn" id="p456">{456}</span>
whole more southerly in its features than that of the countries to the north of the
Bay of Biscay. The orchards produce not only apples, chestnuts, and walnuts,
but also oranges, and in a garden at Oviedo dates ripen in the open air. The
great moisture, however, prevents certain plants from attaining the commercial
importance they would otherwise possess. The mulberry flourishes, but the culture
of silk-worms has only yielded indifferent results, and even the grapes, except in
a few favoured localities, yield but sour wine of disagreeable flavour. Cider, on
the other hand, enjoys a high reputation, and is even exported to America.</p>

<p>The Asturian boasts of having never submitted to the yoke of Mussulmans.
Some of the mountain districts preserved their independence throughout, and
nowhere could the Arabs maintain themselves for any length of time. Oviedo
was called the “city of bishops,” from the great number of prelates who found a
refuge there. The Galicians were equally successful in their resistance to the
Moors, and the blood of the Celtic inhabitants of these remote provinces is thus
purer than anywhere else in Spain.</p>

<p>In some districts the customs are said to have
remained unchanged since <span class="xxpn" id="p457">{457}</span>
the time of the Romans. The herdsmen, or <i>vaqueros</i>, of Leitariegos, on the Upper
Narcea, form almost a distinct tribe. They keep apart from the rest of the Asturians,
and always marry amongst themselves. Old dialects maintain their ground.
The peasants on the coast of Cantabria talk their <i>bable</i>, and in Galicia the dialects
differ even from village to village. The <i>gallego</i>, especially as spoken near the
Miño, is Portuguese rather than Spanish, but a Lusitanian is nevertheless unable
to understand a Galician, owing to the curious sing-song intonation of the latter.</p>

<p>The country supports a dense population, but there are few towns. Many of
these consist merely of a church, a town-hall, and an inn. The homesteads are
scattered over the whole country. This may be due to an innate love of nature,
or perhaps, as in the Basque provinces, to the security which the country has
enjoyed during centuries. Foreign and civil wars have scarcely ever affected these
outlying provinces of Spain. The manners are gentle, and the bloodthirsty bull-fights
of the Castilians unknown. The isolation and peace in which the Cantabrians
were permitted to exist did not, however, prove of advantage in all respects.
Elsewhere in Europe, nobles, priests, citizens, and the peasantry, when threatened
by danger, felt constrained to make concessions to each other. Not so in the
Asturias, where the peasants were reduced to the condition of serfs, and sold with
the land. At the commencement of this century nearly the whole of the land in
the two Asturias was in the hands of twenty-four proprietors, and in the neighbouring
Galicia the conditions were not much more favourable. Matters have changed
since then. The lords have grown poor, the monasteries have been suppressed,
and the industrious Asturians and Galicians have invested their hard-earned savings
in land. Formerly the feudal lords leased the land to the cultivators, who rendered
homage and paid a quit-rent, the lease remaining in force during the reign of two or
three kings, for a hundred years, or even for three hundred and twenty-nine years,
according to the custom of different districts. These leases, however, frequently
led to disputes; the leaseholders, on the expiration of their leases, often refused to
surrender possession, and in numerous instances the law courts sustained them
in this refusal.</p>

<p>The Galicians on the coast divide their time between the cultivation of the
land and fishing. During the season no less than 20,000 men, with 3,000 or 4,000
boats, spread their nets in the Bays of La Coruña, Arosa, Pontevedra, and Vigo,
where tunny-fish and sardines abound. The local consumption of sardines is enormous,
and La Coruña alone exports about 17,000 tons annually to America. These
pursuits, however, are not capable of supporting an increasing population, and
thousands of Galicians emigrate annually. Thrifty and clannish, they usually
succeed in amassing a small competency, and those among them who return exercise
a civilising influence upon their less-cultivated countrymen. Ignorance and poverty,
with all their attendant evils, are great in Galicia, and leprosy and elephantiasis
are common diseases.</p>

<p>One great hindrance to the development of the resources of the country consists
in the paucity of roads and railways. A beginning has been made, but, looking
to the financial condition of Spain, progress will
hardly be rapid. <span class="xxpn" id="p458">{458}</span></p>

<p>Most of the towns of the Asturias are close to the coast. Castro-Urdiales,
Laredo, and Santoña, immediately to the west of the Basque provinces, have
frequently served as naval stations. The roadstead of Santoña is one of the most
commodious and best sheltered of the peninsula, and when Napoleon gave Spain
to his brother Joseph he retained possession of that place, and began fortifications
which would have converted it into a French Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The great commercial port of the country is Santander, with its excellent
harbour, quays, docks, and warehouses, built upon land won from the sea. Santander
is the natural outlet of the Castiles, and exports the flour of Valladolid and
Palencia, as well as the woollen stuffs known as <i>sorianas</i> and <i>leonesas</i> from the
places where they are manufactured. It supplies the interior with the colonial
produce of Cuba and Puerto Rico, and its merchants keep up regular intercourse
with France, England, Hamburg, and Scandinavia.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn165" id="fnanch165">165</a> The ship-building yards
at the head of the bay have lost their former importance, and the manufacture of
cigars is now the great industry of the country. Sardinero, a bathing-place
to the north of the town, and the hot springs of Alcedo, Ontaneda, Las Caldas
de Besaya, in the hills to the south, are favourite places of resort.</p>

<p>Along the coast to the west of Santander, as far as Gijon,
we only meet with <span class="xxpn" id="p459">{459}</span>
villages, such as San Martin de la Arena (the port of the decayed town of Santillana),
San Vicente de la Barquera, Llanes, Rivadesella, and Lástres. Nor is Gijon, with
its huge tobacco factory, a place of importance, though formerly it was the capital
of all Asturias. It exports, however, the coal brought by rail from Sarna (Langres),
and with Aviles, on the other side of the elevated Cabo de Peñas, enjoys the
advantage of being the port of Oviedo, situated in a tributary valley of the Nalon,
fifteen miles in the interior. Oviedo has flourishing iron-works, a university, and a
fine Gothic cathedral, said to be richer in relics than any other church in the
world. The mountain of Naronca shelters the town against northerly winds, and
its climate is delicious. The environs abound in delightful spots. At Cangas de
Onis, which was the first capital of the kingdom, founded by St. Pelagius, but
now merely a village in a charming valley, are the caverns of Covadonga, in which
the ashes of the saint have found a last resting-place, and which are consequently
objects of the highest veneration to patriotic Spaniards. Trubia, the Government
gun and small-arms factory, lies seven miles to the west of Oviedo.</p>

<p>Cudillero, Luarca, Navia (a place said to have been founded by Ham, the
son of Noah), Castropol, and Galician Rivadeo are mere fishing villages, and only
when we reach the magnificent rias opening out into the Atlantic do we again
meet with real towns. The first of these is Ferrol, which was only a village
up to the middle of last century, but has since been converted into a great naval
station and fortress, bristling with guns, and containing dockyards and arsenals.</p>

<p>La Coruña, the Groyne of English sailors, depends rather upon commerce, manufactures,
and fishing than upon its military establishments and fortifications. It
is one of the most picturesque towns of Spain, and its favourable geographical
position will enable it, on the completion of the railway now building, considerably
to extend its commerce, which at present is almost confined to England.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn166" id="fnanch166">166</a>
On a small island near it stands the Tower of Hercules, the foundations of
which date back to the Romans, if not Phœnicians. It was from the ria of Coruña
that the “Invincible Armada” set out upon its disastrous expedition.</p>

<p>Each of the rias of Southern Galicia has its port or ports. That of Corcubion
is sheltered by the Cape of Finisterre; on the ria of Noya are the small towns of
Noya and Muros; that of Arosa is frequented by vessels which convey emigrants
from the ports of Padron and Carril to La Plata; the ria of Pontevedra extends
to the town after which it is named; and farther south still, the towns of Vigo
and Bayona rise on the shore of a magnificent bay, protected by a group of
islands known to the ancients as “Isles of the Gods.” Vigo, with its excellent
harbour, has become the great commercial port of the country,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn167" id="fnanch167">167</a> but is, perhaps,
better known on account of the galleons sunk by Dutch and English privateers.</p>

<p>Three of the principal inland towns of Galicia—viz. Lugo,
Orense, and Tuy—rise on the banks of the Miño. The old
Roman city of Lugo (Lucus Augusti) is enclosed within
mediæval walls, and has warm sulphur springs. Orense, with
its superb old bridge, is likewise celebrated for its hot
springs, or <i>burgas</i>, which are <span class="xxpn" id="p460">{460}</span>
said to raise sensibly the temperature of the plain in winter, and supply the whole
town with water for domestic purposes. Tuy, opposite the Portuguese town of
Valença do Minho, is important only as a frontier fortress. Santiago de Compostela,
the famous old capital of Galicia, on a hill near the winding banks of the
Saria, is the most populous town of North-western Spain. It was here the grave of
St. James the apostle was discovered in the ninth century. The attraction which
it formerly exercised upon pilgrims was immense.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn168" id="fnanch168">168</a></p>

<p>Successive Governments have had recourse to miserable expedients without being
able to disguise the bankrupt condition of the country. The creditors of the State,
no less than the Government officials, remained unpaid, and even schools had to
be closed because the pittance due to the schoolmaster was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>But in spite of this apparent ruin real progress has been made. In order to
fairly judge Spain we must remember that the period when the Inquisition was
permitted to commit its judicial murders is not very remote. In 1780 a woman
of Seville was burnt at the stake for “sorcery and witchcraft.” At that time the
greater part of Spain was held in mortmain, and the
cultivation of the remainder <span class="xxpn" id="p461">{461}</span>
was very indifferently attended to. Ignorance was universal, more especially at
the universities, where science was held in derision.</p>

<p>The great events in the beginning of the nineteenth century have roused the
Spaniards from their torpor, and the country, in spite of temporary checks, has
increased in population and wealth. Labour is more highly respected now than it
was formerly, and whilst monasteries and convents have been emptied, the factories
are crowded with workmen. For much of this progress Spain is indebted to
foreigners. Millions have been invested by them, and, though the expected profits
have scarcely ever been realised, the country at large has permanently profited from
this inflow of capital. The English have given an immense impetus to agriculture
by buying the wines of Andalusia, the corn and flour of the Castilians, and the
cattle of the Galicians. They have likewise developed the mining industry of
Huelva, Linares, Cartagena, and Somorrostro. The French have vastly aided
the manufacturing industry. Foreign capitalists and engineers have established
steamboat lines and railways. The small towns of the interior are awakening
from their lethargy, and modern life is beginning to pulsate through their veins.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn169" id="fnanch169">169</a></p>

<p>In intellectual matters Spain has made even greater progress. Ignorance is
still a great power, especially in the Castiles, where schoolmasters are little
respected, populous towns are without libraries, and catechisms and almanacs are
the only literature of the peasantry. But the position which Spain now holds in
literature and the arts sufficiently proves that the country of Cervantes and
Velasquez is about to resume its place amongst the other countries of Europe. In
science, however, Spain lags far behind, and Michael Servetus is the only Christian
Spaniard whose works mark an epoch in the progress of human knowledge.
But the spirit of inquiry at one time alive amongst the Moors of Andalusia may
possibly revive amongst their descendants.</p>

<p>It is very much to be desired that intellectual progress should mollify the
manners of the people.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn170" id="fnanch170">170</a> It is a scandal that the “noble science of bull-baiting”
should still meet with so large a measure of support in Spain. These bull-fights, as
well as the cock-fights so popular in Andalusia, are sports unworthy a great nation,
and should be put down, just as <i>autos da fé</i> have been put down.</p>

<p>Since a generation or two Spain has got rid of most of her
colonies, which only <span class="xxpn" id="p462">{462}</span>
hindered her moral and material progress. The metropolis is no longer called
upon to uphold slavery, the Inquisition, commercial monopolies, and similar
institutions, “devised to insure the happy government of
these colonies.” These <span class="xxpn" id="p463">{463}</span>
latter certainly have had their revolutions and counter-revolutions, but they have
made some progress in population and wealth. Unfortunately the entire colonial
empire was not lost. Cuba and the Philippine Islands
are frequently represented <span class="xxpn" id="p464">{464}</span>
as adding to the wealth of Spain, and large sums have certainly been paid by
them into the treasury. But these results have been achieved at the cost of
fearful suffering and demoralisation to governors and governed, and unless Spain
adopts the colonial system of England, by granting self-government to colonies, it
will to a certainty lose the last shreds of its colonial empire, after having exhausted
its strength in vain efforts to maintain it.</p>

<p>But though the colonies be lost, the influence of Spain upon the rest of the
world will endure for centuries. Spain has impressed her genius upon every
country subjected at one time or other to her power. Sicily, Naples, Sardinia,
and even Lombardy still exhibit traces of Spanish influence in their architecture
and customs. In Spanish America we find towns inhabited by Indians which
are quite Spanish in their aspect, and almost resemble detached portions of Badajoz
and Valladolid. The Indians themselves have adopted the Castilian tongue, and
with it Castilian manners and modes of thought. A vast territory, twice the size
of Europe, and capable of supporting millions of inhabitants, is occupied now by
Spanish-speaking peoples. <span class="xxpn" id="p465">{465}</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">Since September, 1868, when a revolution upset the Government of Isabella II.,
Spain has passed through a series of revolutions and convulsions, terminating in
December, 1874, in the accession of Alfonso XII., a son of Isabella. Soon afterwards
the revolt in the Basque provinces raised by Don Carlos, the “legitimate”
king of the country, was suppressed, and the work of internal organization could
begin. The legislative power is vested in the King and the Cortes. These latter
include a Senate and a House of Deputies. The Senate consists of hereditary
members (such as royal princes and grandees), of life members chosen by the
King, and of senators elected by corporations. The members of the House of
Deputies are elected for five years. The President and Vice-President of the Senate
are appointed by the King, who enjoys the right of dissolving the Cortes on condition
of fresh elections being ordered within three months.</p>

<p>These governmental revolutions scarcely affected the administration of the
country. The treasury is always empty, the annual receipts do not suffice to pay
the interest upon the national debt, taxes have increased, the conscription demands
more men than ever, and the schools diminish in numbers.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn171" id="fnanch171">171</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p466">{466}</span></p>

<p>The political and administrative divisions of the country have remained the
same since 1841. Spain is divided into forty-nine provinces, including the
Canaries. Each province is subdivided into districts, and has its civil governor.
The communes are governed by an <i>alcalde</i>, or mayor, assisted by an <i>ayuntamiento</i>, or
municipal council, of from four to twenty-eight members. The judicial administration
is modelled on that of France. There are 9,400 justices of the peace (one
for each commune), about 500 inferior courts, 15 courts of appeal, and a supreme
court sitting at Madrid.</p>

<p>For military purposes continental Spain is divided into twelve districts, each
under a captain-general. These are New Castile, Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia,
Valencia with Múrcia, Galicia, Granada, Old Castile, Estremadura, Burgos,
Navarra, and the Basque provinces. The Balearic Isles, the Canaries, Cuba,
Puerto Rico, and the Philippines constitute five additional districts. Military
service is compulsory, but substitutes are admitted on payment of a heavy ransom.
The annual levy varies exceedingly, and as many as 80,000 men are officially stated
to have been levied in a single year, though 60,000 would appear to be the utmost
the population can supply. The term of service is seven years in the cavalry and
artillery, eight years in the infantry, of which three are passed in the “provincial
militia.” About 100,000 men are supposed to be actually under
arms in the <span class="xxpn" id="p467">{467}</span>
peninsula, 130,000 are on furlough, and 70,000 men are stationed in the colonies,
mostly in Cuba, where about one-fourth of the total strength perish annually.</p>

<p>The principal fortresses are St. Sebastian, Santoña, and Santander, on the Bay
of Biscay; Ferrol, La Coruña, and Vigo, on the rias of Galicia; Ciudad Rodrigo,
on the Portuguese frontier; Cádiz and Tarifa, at the entrance of the Strait of
Gibraltar; Málaga, Cartagena, Alicante, and Barcelona, on the Me­di­ter­ra­nean;
Figueras, Pamplona, and Zaragoza, at the foot of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The navy consists of 123 steamers, propelled by engines of 24,694 horse-power,
armed with 755 guns, and manned by 14,000 sailors and 5,500 marines. Six
of these vessels are ironclad frigates. The number of superior officers is exceedingly
large, and their salaries weigh heavily upon the treasury.</p>

<p>Officially the privileges of the nobility have been abrogated. The number of
“noblemen” is, perhaps, larger in Spain than anywhere else in Europe, for the
population of entire provinces, such as the Vascongadas and the Asturias, claims
to have “blue blood” in its veins. In 1787 no less than 480,000 “gentlemen”
were enumerated, not including minors, and if the proportion is the same now,
there must exist at the least 3,000,000 Spaniards who claim to be <i>hidalgos</i>, or
“sons of somebody.” About 1,500 grandees are privileged by custom to remain
covered in the presence of the King, and about 200 of these belong to the highest
rank. All of these do not, however, owe their rank to birth, for many plebeians,
taking advantage of the financial miseries of the country, have succeeded in getting
themselves ennobled. The order of the Golden Fleece, founded in 1431 by Philip
the Good, is one of the distinctions most coveted by
princes and diplomatists. <span class="xxpn" id="p468">{468}</span></p>

<p>The Roman Catholic religion is that of the State, and its prelates enjoy great
privileges, but all other confessions are supposed to be tolerated. The schools,
unfortunately, still remain in the hands of ecclesiastics, who likewise exercise a
censorship with respect to pieces to be produced on the stage. Formerly Spain
was the most priest-ridden country in Europe. At the close of last century there
were 144,000 priests, 71,000 monks, and 35,000 nuns, but only 34,000 merchants.
War and revolutions played havoc with the conventual institutions, but as recently
as 1835 they still harboured 50,000 inmates. Subsequently the whole of them
were suppressed, and in 1869 the last Spanish monk retired from the Carthusian
monastery of Granada to find a refuge in Belgium. Since then, however, the
laws of the land have again been relaxed in favor of monks and priests. There
are 9 archbishops and 54 bishops.</p>

width="238" height="264" alt="P" /></span>ORTUGAL, one of the smallest
states of Europe, was nevertheless during a short epoch one of the most
powerful.</p>

<p>It
might appear at the first glance that Portugal ought to be a
member of a state including the whole of the Iberian peninsula;
but it is neither to chance nor to events purely historical that
Portugal owes its separate existence. The country is one by its climate, fauna, and
vegetation, and the inhabitants dwelling within it naturally adopted the same sort
of life, nourished the same ideas, and joined in the same body politic. It was by
advancing along the coast, from river to river, from the Douro to the Minho and
Tejo, from the Tejo to the Guadiana, that Portugal constituted itself an independent
state.</p>

<p>Soil and climate mark off Portugal very distinctly from the rest of the Iberian
peninsula. Speaking generally, that country embraces the Atlantic slopes of the
plateau of Spain, and the limit of the heavy rains brought by westerly winds
coincides very nearly with the political boundary between the two countries. On
one side of the line we have a humid atmosphere, frequent rains, and luxuriant
forests; on the other a brazen sky, a parched soil, naked rocks, and treeless plains.
These abundant rains convert the feeble streams flowing from the plateau into great
rivers. The natural obstacles, such as rapids, which obstruct the principal amongst
them, are met with near the political frontier of the country. The harbour of
Lisbon was the kernel, as it were, around which the rest of the country has become
crystallized. Its power of attraction proved equal to that which caused the rest of
the peninsula to gravitate towards Madrid and Toledo.</p>

<p>As frequently happens where neighbouring nations obey different laws and
are made to fight each other at the caprice of their sovereigns, there is no love
lost between Spaniards and Portuguese. The former, being the stronger, sneer at
“Portugueses pocos y locos” (small and crack-brained). The Portuguese are far
more demonstrative in giving expression to their aversion.
Formerly “Murderer <span class="xxpn" id="p470">{470}</span>
of the Castilians” was a favourite sign-board of houses of entertainment, and the
national poetry breathes passionate hatred of the Spaniard. This animosity must
interfere with the Iberian union, advocated only by a handful of people.</p>

<p>Ancient Lusitania was inhabited by Celtic and Iberian tribes, who resisted for
a considerable time the conquering arms of Rome. Those dwelling near the coast
had been subjected to the influence of Greek, Phœnician, and Carthaginian
colonists; but the influence exercised by the Romans, who forced their language
and form of government upon the people, was far more durable. Suevi and
Visigoths have left but few traces of their presence. The Mo­ham­me­dans of
various races have largely modified the blood and manners of the inhabitants,
especially in Algarve, where they maintained themselves to the middle of the
thirteenth century. The numerous ruins of fortresses existing throughout the
country bear witness to the severe struggles which took place between these races
before uniformity of government and religion was established.</p>

<p>The Kings of Portugal, taking the advice of the Inquisition, expelled all heretics.
The persecution of the Moors was pitiless, but the Jews were occasionally granted
a respite. The Spanish Jews settled near the frontier,
having outwardly embraced <span class="xxpn" id="p471">{471}</span>
the Christian religion, were permitted to remain; but the more conscientious
Jews kept true to their faith, and carried the knowledge they possessed to other
countries of Europe and to the East. At the time of their exile they were
engaged in literature, medicine, and law, as well as in commerce; at Lisbon they
had founded an academy of high repute; it was a Jew who introduced the art of
printing into Portugal; and Spinoza, that noble and powerful thinker, was a Jew
of Portuguese extraction.</p>

<p>But the Portuguese have not only the blood of Arabs, Berbers, and Jews in
their veins, they are likewise much mixed with negroes, more particularly in the
south and along the coast. The slave trade existed long before the negroes of
Guinea were exported to the plantations of America. Damianus a Goes estimated
the number of blacks imported into Lisbon alone during the sixteenth century at
10,000 or 12,000 per annum. If contemporary eye-witnesses can be trusted,
the number of blacks met with in the streets of Lisbon equalled that of the
whites. Not a house but had its negro servants, and the wealthy owned entire
gangs of them. The immunity of Portuguese immigrants who face the deadly
climates of the tropics is sometimes ascribed to this infusion of negro blood, but
erroneously as we think. Most of these immigrants come from the mountains of
the north, where the race is almost pure; and if the Portuguese become acclimatized
more rapidly than individuals of other nations, they owe it to their sobriety.</p>

<p>At the present day it is the Galicians who exercise most influence upon the
population of Lusitania. They immigrate in large numbers to Lisbon and other
towns, where they gain their living as bakers, porters, doorkeepers, and domestic
servants. Being ridiculed on account of their uncouth language and rustic
manners, they mix but little with the rest of the population. Their numbers,
however, are ever increasing, and their thrift and industry soon place them in a
position of ease.</p>

<p>The mixture of these diverse elements has not produced a handsome race. The
Portuguese possess but rarely the noble mien of the Spaniard. Their features,
as a rule, are irregular, the nose is turned up, and the lips are thick. Cripples
are rare amongst them, but so are tall men. Squat and short, they are inclined to
corpulency. The women cannot boast the fiery beauty of the Spaniards, but have
brilliant eyes, an abundance of hair, animated features, and amiable manners.</p>

<p>Travellers speak highly of the manners, civility, and kindness of the peasantry
not yet contaminated by commerce. The cruelties committed by Portuguese
conquerors in the Indies and the New World have given the nation a bad reputation,
though, as a rule, the Portuguese has compassion for all sorts of suffering.
He is a gambler, but never quarrels; he is fond of bull-fights, but takes care to
wrap up the bull’s horns in cork, in order that the animal may be saved for future
contests; and he is exceedingly kind to domestic animals. In their intercourse the
Portuguese are good-tempered, obliging, and polished. To tell a Lusitanian that
he has been “brought up badly” is to offend him most seriously. Their oratory
is elegant, though ceremonious. Even the peasants express themselves with a
facility and command of words remarkable in a people so
badly educated. Oaths <span class="xxpn" id="p472">{472}</span>
and indecent expressions scarcely ever pass their mouth, and, though great talkers,
and even boasters, they are most guarded in their
conversation. Portugal has <span class="xxpn" id="p473">{473}</span>
produced great orators, and one of her poets, Camões, is amongst the most illustrious
the world has ever seen. On the other hand, Portugal has given birth
to no great artist, for Gran Vasco is a mythical personage. Camões himself avows
this when he says, “Our nation is the first because of its great qualities. Our
men are more heroic than other men; our women better-looking than other women;
and we excel in all the arts of peace and war, excepting in the art of painting.”</p>

<p>Portuguese is very much like Castilian as far as root-words and general
construction are concerned, but is far less voluminous and sonorous. Nasal and
hissing sounds, which a foreigner finds it difficult to pronounce, abound, but there
are no gutturals. Arab words are less numerous in Portuguese than in Castilian,
but the Lusitanians, as well as the Spaniards, still swear by the god of the
Mo­ham­me­dans—<i>Oxala</i> (<i>Ojalà</i>); that is, “If Allah wills it.”</p>

<p>The Portuguese cannot compare in numbers with the other nations of Europe,
and their influence upon the destinies of the world is consequently small. At one
time of their history, however, they surpassed all other nations by their maritime
enterprise. The Spaniards certainly shared in the great discoveries of the fifteenth
century, but it was the Portuguese who made them possible by first venturing to
navigate the open ocean. It was a Portuguese, Magalhães, who undertook the
first voyage round the world, terminated only after his death. A similar pre-eminence
amongst nations will never be met with again, for the increased facilities
of communication exercise a levelling influence upon all. Portugal, therefore, can
never again hope to resume the national status which she held formerly, but her
great natural resources and favourable geographical position at the extremity of
the continent must always insure her an honourable place amongst them.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The mountains of Lusitania are a portion of the great orographical system of
the whole peninsula; but they are not mere spurs, gradually sinking down towards
the sea, for they rise into independent ranges; and the individuality of Portugal
is manifested in the relief of its soil quite as much as in the history of its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The mountains rising in the north-eastern corner of Portugal, to the south of
the Minho, may be looked upon as the outer barrier of an ancient lake, which
formerly covered the whole of the plains of Old Castile. From the Pyrenees to
the Sierra de Gata this barrier was continuous, and the breaches now existing date
only from a comparatively recent epoch, and are due to the erosive action of
torrents. The most considerable of these breaches, that of the Douro, could have
been effected only by overcoming most formidable obstacles.</p>

<p>The most northern mountain mass of Portugal, that of the Peneda of Gavieiro
(4,727 feet), rises abruptly beyond the region of forest, and commands the Sierra
Peñagache (4,065 feet) on the Spanish frontier to the east, as well as the hills of
Santa Luzia (1,814 feet) and others near the coast. Another
mountain mass rises <span class="xxpn" id="p474">{474}</span>
immediately to the south of the gorge through which the Limia passes after leaving
Spain. This is the Serra do Gerez (4,815 feet), a range of twisted, grotesquely
shaped mountains, the only counterpart of which in the peninsula is the famous
Serranía de Ronda. This range, together with the Larouco (5,184 feet), to the
east of it, must be looked upon as the western extremity of the Cantabrian Pyrenees,
and like them it consists of granitic rocks.</p>

<p>The flora of these northern frontier mountains of Portugal much resembles that
of Galicia, and on their slopes the botanist meets with a curious intermingling of
the vegetation of France, and even Germany, with that of the Pyrenees, Biscay, and
the Portuguese lowlands. On the southern summits, however, and more especially
on the Serra de Marão (4,665 feet), which forms a bold promontory between the
Douro and its important tributary the Tamega, and shelters the wine districts
of Oporto from north-westerly winds, the opportunities for examining into the
arborescent flora are but few, for the forests which once clad them have disappeared.
The schistose plateaux to the east of them and to the north of the Douro
have likewise been robbed of their forests to make room for vineyards. Most
wild animals have disappeared with the forests, but wolves are still numerous, and
are much dreaded by the herdsmen. The mountain goat (<i>Capra ægagrus</i>), which
existed until towards the close of last century in the Serra do Gerez, has become
extinct. The Serra da Cabreira (4,196 feet), to the east of Braga, is probably
indebted for its name to these wild goats.</p>

<p>If the Serra do Gerez may be looked upon as the western extremity of the
Pyrenean system, the magnificent Serra da Estrella (6,540 feet), which rises between
the Douro and Tejo, is undoubtedly a western prolongation of the great
central range of Spain which separates the plateaux of the two Castiles. These
“Star Mountains” are attached to the mountains of Spain by a rugged table-land,
or <i>mesa</i>, of comparatively small height. The great granitic Serra da
Estrella rises gently above the broken ground which gives birth to the Mondego.
It can easily be ascended from that side, and is hence known as the <i>Serra Mansa</i>,
“the tame mountain.” On the south, however, above the valley of the Zezere,
the slopes are abrupt and difficult of access, and are known for that reason as <i>Serra
Brava</i>; that is, “wild mountain.” Delightful lakelets, similar to those of the
Pyrenees and Carpathians, are met with near the highest summit of the range,
the Malhão de Serra. The tops of the Serra da Estrella remain covered with snow
during four months of the year, and supply the inhabitants of Lisbon with the
ice required for the preparation of their favourite sherbet. The orographical
system of the Estrella ends with the Serra de Lousão (3,940 feet), for the hills
of Estremadura, which terminate in the Cabo da Roca, a landmark well known to
mariners, belong to another geological formation, and consist for the most part of
Jurassic strata overlying the cretaceous formation.</p>

<p>The mountains of Beira and Entre Douro e Minho are exposed to the full
influence of the moisture-laden south-westerly winds, and the rainfall is considerable.
The rain does not descend in torrents, as in tropical countries, but pours
down steadily. It is more abundant in winter and spring, but not
a month passes <span class="xxpn" id="p475">{475}</span>
without it. Fogs are frequent at the mouths of valleys and along the coast as far
south as the latitude of Coimbra. At that place as much as sixteen feet of rain
has fallen in a single year, an amount only to be equalled within the tropics.</p>

<p>The humidity of the air accounts for the great equability of the climate of
Northern Portugal. At Coimbra the difference between the coldest and warmest
month amounts to but 20° F. Frosts are severe only on the plateaux exposed to
the north-easterly winds, and the heat becomes unbearable in deep valleys alone,
where the air cannot circulate freely.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn173" id="fnanch173">173</a> At Penafiel, where the rays of the sun are
thrown back by the rocky precipices, the heat is almost that of a furnace. This,
however, is an exception, and the climate generally can be described as temperate.</p>

<p>Running water is abundant. Camões has sung the beauties of the fields of
Coimbra watered by the Mondego, the charms of cascades sparkling amidst foliage,
and the purity of the springs bursting forth from rocks clad with verdure. The
Vouga, the affluents of the Douro, the Ave, Cavado, and Lima,
likewise take their <span class="xxpn" id="p476">{476}</span>
devious courses through smiling landscapes whose beauties are set off by rocks and
mountains. The Lima, whose delights might well cause Roman soldiers to forget
the rivers of their own country, is the only river of the peninsula still in a state
of geological transition. All others have drained the lakes which gave birth to
them, but in the case of the Lima that old lake basin is still occupied by a swamp,
known as Laguna Beon, or Antela, the
only remains of a mountain-girt inland
lake as large as that of Geneva.</p>

<p>The current of the rivers of Northern
Portugal is too great to permit of their
being uti­lised as high-roads of commerce.
They have ports at their mouths, but the
Douro, which drains nearly a sixth of the
Iberian pe­nin­sula, is the only one amongst
them which fa­ci­li­tates access to an inland
dis­trict. Mariners dread to approach the
coast when the wind blows on shore.
Be­tween the Minho and Cabo Car­voeiro, a
dis­tance of 200 miles, the coast presents
features very much like those of the
French landes. Its original in­den­ta­tions
and ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties have been ob­li­ter­ated
by bar­riers of sand. The lower valley of
the Vouga was for­mer­ly an in­let of the
sea ex­tending far inland. The basin of
Aveiro re­sembles geo­logi­cal­ly that of
Arcachon. Its wa­ters abound in fish, but
the Douro is the south­ern­most ri­ver of
Europe visited by salmon. The abundance
of life in cer­tain localities of it is
fig­ur­a­tive­ly ex­pressed by a Spa­nish pro­verb,
which says, “The water of the
Douro is not wa­ter, but broth.”</p>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The rec­ti­lin­ear beach of Beira-mar is lined for the most part
with dunes, the old gulfs behind which are gradually being con­verted
into in­sa­lub­rious swamps, fringed by heath, ferns, strawberry-trees,
and broom, whilst the neigh­bour­ing forests consist of oaks and
pines. Formerly these dunes invaded the cul­ti­vated portions of the
country, as they still do in France, where like geological causes have
produced like results. But long before a similar plan was thought of
in France these Por­tu­guese dunes were planted with pines, and as early
as the reign of King Diniz “the Labourer,” at the be­gin­ning of the
four­teenth cen­tury, they had ceased to “march.” <span class="xxpn"
id="p477">{477}</span></p>

<p>The population of the cultivable portions of the basins of the Minho and Douro
is very dense, and in order to maintain themselves the inhabitants are forced to
work zealously. Their country is the most carefully cultivated of the peninsula.
In a large measure this industry is due to the fact of the peasantry being the
owners of the land they cultivate, or at least <i>affarádos</i>—that is, copyholders—who
only pay a few shillings annually to the lords of the manors. Many of
the peasants are wealthy, and the women are fond of loading themselves with
jewellery, amongst which necklaces made in the Moorish taste are most prominent.
The cultivation of the fields is attended to with scrupulous care; and
the most ingenious methods are employed for the irrigation of the upper slopes
of the hills, which are frequently cut up into terraces, or <i>geios</i>. These Northern
Portuguese are as distinguished for moral excellence as they are for industry.
Their sweetness of disposition, gaiety and kindliness are the theme of universal
praise, and as regards their love of dancing and music they are veritable Theocritan
shepherds. Challenges in improvised verses form one of the amusements
of young men. Nor is the population devoid of physical beauty. The women
of Aveiro, though often enfeebled by malaria, have the reputation of being the
prettiest in all Portugal.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the vine and the making of port wine constitute the principal
branch of industry of the country. The chief vine-growing district, ordinarily
known as <i>Paiz do Vinho</i>, lies to the north of the Douro, between the Serra de
Marão and the Tua, and is exposed to the full force of the rays of the summer sun.
In the middle of the seventeenth century the cultivation of this district had hardly
begun. The English had not then learnt to appreciate these growths, and were
content with the various Portuguese wines shipped from Lisbon. It was only
after the treaty concluded by Lord Methuen in 1702 that the cultivation of the
vine assumed certain dimensions in the district of the Douro, and ever since the
reputation of port has been on the increase. The Marquis of Pombal founded a
company for the production of wine, and the small town of Pezo da Regoa, on the
Corgo, then became famous for its wine fairs, at which fortunes were lost and won,
and a town of wine cellars and stores sprang up opposite the town of Porto, or
Oporto, near the mouth of the Douro. For more than a hundred years port and
sherry have kept their place on the tables of English gentlemen, and nearly all the
wine produced on the banks of the Dóuro finds its way to England or to British
colonies. Indeed, up to 1852 the best quality, known as “factory wine,” could
be exported to England alone. Next to the English the Brazilians are the best
customers of Oporto: they receive nearly 1,000,000 gallons of wine annually.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn174" id="fnanch174">174</a></p>

<p>The breeding of mules and fattening of Spanish cattle
for the London market yield considerable profit. Early
vegetables are forwarded not only to London but also to Rio
de Janeiro. Manufactures were already of some importance in
the <span class="xxpn" id="p478">{478}</span>
Middle Ages, and have recently been much developed by enterprising English
capitalists. Oporto has cotton, linen, silk, and woollen mills, foundries and sugar
refineries, and its jewellers and glove-makers enjoy a good repute. But agriculture,
industry and legitimate commerce, and even the smuggling carried on in
the frontier district of Bragança, do not suffice to support the ever-increasing
population, and thousands emigrate annually to Lisbon and Brazil.</p>

<p>Northern Portugal may be described as the cradle of the existing kingdom,
and it was Porto Cale, on the site of Villanova de Gaia, the southern suburb
of Oporto, which gave a name to all Lusitania. At Lamego, to the south of
the Douro, the Cortes met, according to tradition, in 1143, and constituted the
new kingdom of which Oporto became the capital. When the country recovered
its independence after the short dominion of Spain, the Dukes of Bragança were
invested with the regal power. Though Lisbon occupies a more central position
than Oporto, the latter frequently takes the initiative in political movements, and
the success of any revolution is said to depend upon the side taken by the energetic
population of the north. If we may accept the estimate of the <i>Portuenses</i>, they are
morally and physically the superiors of the <i>Lisbonenses</i>. They alone are the true
sons of the great people whose vessels ploughed the ocean during the age of discoveries,
and there can be no doubt that their gait is more determined, their
speech and their glance more open, than those of the inhabitants of the capital.
In vulgar parlance, people of Oporto and Lisbon are known as <i>tripeiros</i> and
<i>alfasinhos</i>; that is, tripe and lettuce eaters.</p>

<p>Porto, or O Porto, the “Port” <i>par excellence</i>, is the
natural capital of Northern Lusitania, the second city of
Portugal on account of its population and commerce, the
first in manufactures. As seen from the banks of the Douro,
here hardly <span class="xxpn" id="p479">{479}</span>
more than 200 yards in width, and spanned by a magnificent railway bridge, it
rises like a double amphitheatre, whose summits are crowned by the cathedral
and the belfry <i>dos Clerigos</i>, and the narrow valley separating them covered with
houses. The lower town has broad streets, intersecting each other at right angles,
but the streets climbing the hills are narrow and tortuous, and even stairs have
frequently to be ascended in order to reach the more elevated quarters of the town.
Cleanliness is attended to throughout, and the citizens are most anxious in that
respect to insure the praises of their numerous English visitors. Gaia, a long
suburb, occupies the opposite side of the river. It abounds in factories and storehouses,
and its vast cellars are stated on an average to contain 80,000 pipes of wine.
Beautiful walks extend along the river bank and its terraces, and the long reaches
of the stream are covered with shipping, and fringed with gardens and villas. The
hills in the distance are crowned with ancient convents, fortifications, and villages
half hidden amongst verdure. Avintes, famous for the beauty of its women, who
supply the town daily with <i>broa</i>, or maize bread, is one of them. Suburbs extend
along both banks of the river in the direction of the sea. The river at its mouth
is only two fathoms in depth during low water, and dangerous of access when the
wind blows from the west. Even at Oporto vessels of 400 or 500 tons are exposed
to danger from sudden floods of the river, which cause them to drag their anchors.
The port of the Douro has therefore to contend with great difficulties in its rivalry
with Lisbon.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn175" id="fnanch175">175</a></p>

<p>The small town of São João da Foz, at the mouth of the Douro, has a lighthouse,
but carries on no commerce. Near it are Mattozinhos and Leça, the latter
of which boasts of an ancient monastery resembling a fortress, and is much frequented
on account of its fine beach and refreshing sea breezes. Espinho, to the south of
the Douro, is another favourite seaside resort, in spite of the all-pervading smell of
sardines. The small ports to the north of the Douro are frequented only by coasting
vessels or by seaside visitors. The entrance to the Minho is defended by the castle
of Insua, on a small island, as its name implies, and by the insignificant fortress of
Caminha. The river is accessible only to vessels drawing less than six feet. The
mouth of the Lima, though even more difficult of access, is nevertheless occupied by
a town of some importance—coquettish Vianna do Castello, beautifully ensconced
amidst the verdure of its fertile plain. Other towns are Espozende, at the mouth
of the Cávado, and Villa do Conde, at that of the Ave. Formerly most of the vessels
engaged in the slave trade and those employed in the great maritime enterprises
of the Portuguese were built here, and it still boasts of a few ship-yards.</p>

<p>Amongst the inland towns of Entre Douro e Minho are Ponte
de Lima, famous for the beauty of the surrounding country;
Barcellos, overhanging the shady banks of the Cávado; and
Amarante, celebrated for its wines and peaches, and proud
of a fine bridge spanning the Tamega. But the only towns
important on account of their population are Braga and
Guimarães, both placed on commanding heights overlooking a
most fertile country. Braga (Bracara Augusta), an ancient
Roman colony, the capital of the Galicians, then of the
Suevi, and later on the residence of <span class="xxpn" id="p480">{480}</span>
the Kings of Portugal, became the primatial city of the whole of the peninsula when
the two kingdoms were temporarily united under the same sovereign. But Braga
is not only a town of the past, it is even now a bustling place, where hats, linens,
arms, and beautiful filigree are manufactured for exportation to the rest of Portugal
and the Portuguese colonies. Guimarães is equally as interesting as Braga on
account of its monuments and mediæval legends. Visitors are still shown the
sacred olive-tree which sprang from a seed placed in the soil by King Wamba,
when still a common labourer; and Affonso, the founder of the Portuguese
monarchy, was born in the old castle. Guimarães is a busy manufacturing town;
it produces cutlery, hardware, and table-linen, and English visitors never fail to
purchase there a curiously ornamented box of prunes. Near it are much-frequented
sulphur springs, known to the Romans as <i>Aquæ Levæ</i>. But the
most famous mineral springs of modern Portugal are the Caldas do Gerez, in a
tributary valley of the Upper Cávado.</p>

<p>The towns of Traz os Montes and Beira Alta are too far removed from highways
to have attracted a considerable population. Villa Real, on the Corgo, is the
busiest place of Traz os Montes, owing to the vineyards
in its neighbourhood. <span class="xxpn" id="p481">{481}</span>
Chaves, an old fortress near the Spanish frontier, boasts of one of those Roman
bridges which have rendered the century of Trajan famous: it was formerly noted
for its mineral springs (<i>Aquæ Flaviæ</i>). Bragança, the old provincial capital, has a
commanding citadel, and, owing to its geographical position, is an important place
for smugglers, the legitimate exports fluctuating regularly with the customs tariff.
It is the most important place in Portugal for the production of raw silk. Lamego,
a picturesque town to the south of the Douro, opposite the Paiz do Vinho, enjoys
a great reputation for its hams; Almeida, which keeps in check the garrison of
Spanish Ciudad Rodrigo, was anciently one of the strongest fortresses of Portugal;
and Vizeu is an important station between the Douro and the Mondego. Its fairs
are more frequented than any others in Portugal, and in its cathedral may be seen
the famous masterpiece painted by the mythical Gran Vasco. The herdsmen
around Vizéu are noted for their strength and beauty. Their uncovered heads
and bare legs give them an appearance of savagery, but their manners are as
polished and dignified as those of the rest of their countrymen.</p>

<p>Coimbra (<i>Æminium</i>), in Beira-mar, is the most populous town between Oporto
and Lisbon. It is known more especially for its university, whose professors and
students impart to it the aspect of a mediæval seat of learning. The purest Portuguese
is spoken there. The environs are delightful, and in the botanical garden
the plants of the tropics mingle with those of the temperate zones. From the banks
of the Mondego, upon which the city is built, visitors frequently ascend to the <i>Quinta
das Lagrimos</i> (“house of tears”), the scene of the murder of the beauteous Inez
de Castro, whose death was so cruelly revenged by her husband, Peter the Judge.</p>

<p>Few countries in the world can rival the beautiful valley of the Mondego, that
“river of the Muses” held dear by all the Lusitanians, because it is the only one
which belongs to them exclusively. Condeixa, a town near Coimbra, fully
deserves to be called the “Basket of Fruit,” for its gardens produce most
exquisite oranges. In the north the ruins of the monastery of Bussaco occupy a
mountain terrace covered with a dense forest of cypresses, cedars, oaks, elms, and
exotic trees. This delightful place and the hot springs of Luso, near it, are a
favourite summer residence of the citizens of Lisbon and Coimbra.</p>

<p>Figueira da Foz, the port of Coimbra, is well sheltered,
but, like most other ports of Northern Portugal, is
obstructed by a bar of sand. It is nevertheless much
frequented by coasting vessels, and amongst its exports are
the wines of Barraida. Ovar and Aveiro, in the “Portuguese
Netherlands,” on the banks of a lagoon separated by a
series of dunes from the high sea, are the two other ports
of this part of the coast. They were important places
during the Middle Ages, but the shifting bars, which
render access to them difficult, have put a stop to their
prosperity. The seamen of these two places have a high
reputation for daring. They engage in sardine-fishing,
oyster-dredging, and the manufacture of bay-salt.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn176" id="fnanch176">176</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p482">{482}</span></p>

lower course of the Tejo, called Tajo in Spain, separates Portugal into two
portions differing much in their general aspect, climate, and soil. The valley
itself is a sort of intermediary between the north and south, and the vast estuary
into which the river discharges itself.</p>

<p>Where the Tejo enters Portugal, below the magnificent bridge of Alcántara, it
is still hemmed in between precipitous banks, and is neither navigable nor available
for purposes of irrigation. Having traversed the defile of Villa Velha do Rodão,
its valley gradually widens, and after having received its most considerable
tributary, the Zezere, it becomes a tranquil stream, abounding in islands and sand-banks,
and is navigable during the whole of the year. Below Salvaterra the
river bifurcates, its two branches enclosing the marshy island of Lezirias. The
vast estuary which begins below this island is an arm of the sea rather than a
river; its waters are saline, and between Sacavem and
Alhandra there are <span class="xxpn" id="p483">{483}</span>
salt-pans. The Tejo affords one of the most striking instances of a river encroaching
upon its western bank, which is steep and hilly, whilst the left bank is low.</p>

<p>The irregular range of hills which forms the back-bone of the peninsula
enclosed by the Lower Tejo and the ocean is attached to the mountain of Estrella
by a ravined plateau of trifling elevation, crossed by the railway connecting Coimbra
with Santarem. From the summit of the Serra do Aire (“wind mountain,” 2,222
feet) we look down upon the verdant valley of the Tejo and the reddish-hued
plains of Alemtejo beyond it. Monte Junto (2,185 feet), farther south, is another
commanding summit. The rocky promontory of Carvoeiro is joined to the mainland
by a sandy beach. Upon it stands the little fortress of Peniche, whose
inhabitants lead a life of seclusion, and are engaged in the manufacture of lace.
A submarine plateau connects this promontory with Berlinga Island, with an old
castle now used as a prison, and with the Farilhãos, dreaded by mariners.</p>

<p>The hills on the narrow peninsula to the north of Lisbon are of small height,
but, owing to their rugged character, they present great obstacles to in­ter­com­mu­ni­ca­tion.
It was here Wellington constructed the famous lines of Torres
Vedras, which converted the environs of Lisbon into a vast entrenched camp. To
the south of these rise the beautiful heights of Cintra, celebrated for their palaces,
shady valleys, delightful climate, and historical associations.
Sheets of basalt, <span class="xxpn" id="p484">{484}</span>
ejected from some ancient volcano, cover the hills between Lisbon and Sacavem,
and the great earthquakes of 1531 and 1755 prove that subterranean forces were
then not quite extinct. The second of these earthquakes was probably the most
violent ever witnessed in Europe. The very first shock destroyed 3,850 houses in
Lisbon, burying 15,000 human beings beneath the ruins; a minute afterwards an
immense wave, nearly forty feet in height, swept off the fugitives who crowded
the quay. Only one quarter of the town, that anciently inhabited by the Moors,
escaped destruction. The Marquis de Pombal erected a gallows in the midst of the
ruins to deter plunderers. From the focus of vibration the oscillations of the soil
were propagated over an immense area, estimated at no less than 1,000,000 square
miles. Oporto was destroyed in part, the harbour of Alvor in Algarve was silted
up, and it is said that nearly all the large towns of Morocco tumbled into ruins.</p>

<p>The gully which connects the open ocean with the inland sea of Lisbon, and
through which the Tejo discharges its waters, separates the cretaceous hills of
Cintra from the isolated Serra da Arabida (1,537 feet), to the west of Setúbal,
which belong to the same geological formation. These two groups of hills were
probably portions of one range at a time when the Tejo still took its course across
what are now the tertiary plains of Alemtejo, and reached the sea much farther to
the south, through the estuary of the Sado.</p>

<p>Lisbon (Lisbõa), though the number of its inhabitants is less than half what it
was in the sixteenth century, exhibits no trace of the havoc wrought in 1755. Even
the central portions of the town have risen from the ruins, and huge blocks of
houses, imposing by their size, if not by their architecture, have taken the places
of the older structures. The present city extends four miles along the Tejo, but
including its suburbs, between Poco do Bispo and the Tower of Belem, its extent
is nine miles. The city stretches inland a distance of two or three miles, and,
like Rome, is said to be built upon seven hills. A beautiful promenade connects
it with Belem. As seen from the Tejo, or from the hills opposite, Lisbon, with
its towers, cupolas, and public walks, certainly presents a magnificent spectacle,
and there is some truth in the proverb which says―</p>

</div></div><!--dpoem-->

<p>Unfortunately the interior of the superb metropolis does not correspond with
the imposing beauty of its exterior. Lisbon has a noble square, called Largo do
Comercio; it has all the various buildings which one expects to meet with in the
capital of a kingdom and an important maritime town; but, with the exception of
the chapel of São João Baptista, not one amongst them is remarkable for its
architecture. The only important structure outside the city is the famous
aqueduct Os Arcos das Agoas, which was built by João V., the <i>Rei Edificador</i>,
in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and sustained no injury during the
earthquake of 1755. On approaching the city it crosses a valley on a superb
marble bridge of thirty-five arches, the highest of which is 246 feet in height.</p>

<p>Lisbon is important not only as regards Portugal, but also, on account of
its position, with reference to the rest of Europe—nay, of the entire world.
As long as the Me­di­ter­ra­nean was the theatre of human history it remained in
obscurity, but no sooner had mariners ventured beyond the columns of Hercules
than the beautiful harbour at the mouth of the Tejo became one of the principal
points of departure for vessels starting upon voyages of discovery. Lisbon became
the most advanced outpost of Europe on the Atlantic, for it offered greater facilities
than any other port for voyages directed to the Azores, Madeira, the Canaries, and
the western coasts of Africa. The achievements of Portuguese mariners have passed
into history. Vast territories in every quarter of the globe became tributary to
little Portugal, and it needed the epic force of a Camões to celebrate these wonderful
conquests.</p>

<p>That age of glory lasted but a short time, for proud Lisbon, which had become
known to Eastern nations as the “City of the Franks,” as if it were the capital of
Europe, lost its pre-eminent position towards the close of
the sixteenth century. <span class="xxpn" id="p486">{486}</span>
Portugal capsized suddenly, like a small barge overcrowded with sails. Crushed
by the terrible reign of Philip II., enervated by luxury, and grown disdainful of
honest labour, as slaveholders always will, Lisbon was constrained to see much of
its commerce and most of its valued colonies pass into the hands of Spaniards and
Dutchmen. But, in spite of these disasters, Lisbon is still a commercial port of
great importance, although as yet no direct line of railway connects it with Madrid
and the rest of Europe. England occupies the foremost position amongst the
customers of the town, and the Brazilians, whose severance from the mother
country was at first looked upon as an irremediable disaster, follow next.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn177" id="fnanch177">177</a> Spain,
though it borders upon Portugal for several hundred miles, scarcely enters into
commercial relations with it. Civil wars have, however, driven many Spanish
exiles to Lisbon, and these have already exercised a considerable influence upon
manners. Formerly only men were to be seen in the streets of Lisbon, the women
being confined almost with the same rigour as in a Mo­ham­me­dan city, but the
example set by Spanish ladies has found many imitators amongst their Portuguese
sisters. The towns in the immediate vicinity of Lisbon are celebrated for their
picturesque beauties.</p>

<p>Portuguese Estremadura, which neither suffers from northern
frosts nor from fogs and aridity, can boast of a climate
approaching that of the fabled Islands of the Happy. At
Lisbon snow, or “white rain,” as it is called, falls <span class="xxpn" id="p487">{487}</span>
rarely, but it may be seen glittering on the summits of the Serras da Estrella
and de Lousão. Its fall near the sea-coast is looked upon as an evil omen, and
a heavy snow-storm, as recently as last century, frightened the inhabitants of
Lisbon to such an extent that they fancied the day of judgment had come, and
rushed into the churches.</p>

<p>The regular alternation between land and sea breezes is likewise an advantage
possessed by the neighbourhood of Lisbon. From the beginning of May throughout
the fine season the wind blows from the land in the morning, by noon it has
shifted to the south, in the evening it blows from the west and north-west, and
during the night from the north. Hence its name of <i>viento roteiro</i>; that is, “rotary
wind.” As to the winds forming part of the regular system of atmospheric
circulation, they blow with far less regularity. The polar winds, stopped by the
transversal mountain ranges of the country, either follow the direction of the
coast or are diverted to the plateaux of Spain, and make their appearance in
Portugal as easterly winds. It is these latter which render the summer oppressively
hot. At Lisbon the thermometer rises occasionally to 100° F., and in 1798
even 104° were observed. Experience has taught us that although the heat at
Rio de Janeiro is in excess of that of Lisbon, the dog-days at the latter place are
more unbearable.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn178" id="fnanch178">178</a></p>

<p>The vegetation of the happy district where the climate of North and South
intermingle is twofold in its aspect. The date-palm makes its appearance in the
gardens of Lower Estremadura; the dwarf palm grows in the open air along the
coast; the agave raises its candelabra-like branches as on the coast of Mexico;
the camellias are more beautiful than anywhere else in Europe; and the hedges are
composed of prickly cacti (<i>Nopal</i>), as in Sicily and Algeria. The fruits of the
Me­di­ter­ra­nean ripen to perfection; and even the mango of the Antilles, only
recently introduced, has found a congenial climate. Oranges are known as <i>portogalli</i>
in several countries as far as Egypt, as if the inhabitants of Portugal
had been the first to whom these golden apples were known; and even the word
<i>chintarah</i>, or <i>chantarah</i>, by which the orange is known in some parts of India, is
supposed to be a corruption of the name of the Portuguese town of Cintra.</p>

<p>Belem (Bethlehem) is the nearest of the suburban towns of Lisbon, being
separated from it merely by a rivulet named Alcántara, after an old Moorish
bridge. It is the first place beheld by a mariner approaching Lisbon, and its
square tower, built by King John the Perfect, is seen from afar. It was hence
Vasco da Gama started upon the memorable expedition which taught the Portuguese
the road to India, and a magnificent monastery, now converted into an
educational institution, was built in commemoration of this glorious event.</p>

<p>Oeiras, at the mouth of a small rivulet coming down from the heights of
Cintra, defends the entrance to the Tejo by means of Fort São Julião; Carcavellos,
noted for its wines, lies farther on; and Cascães, with a small harbour defended by
a citadel, brings us to the open ocean. The coast beyond
this is protected by <span class="xxpn" id="p488">{488}</span>
towers, but there are no inhabitants. The hills of Cintra, however are one of
the most populous districts of the country, and they are much frequented by
foreigners. Whether we follow the carriage road or the tramroad from Lisbon,
we pass the castles and villas of Bomfica, the royal palace of Queluz, and
the country seats of Bellas, the fountain of which supplies the capital with water.
Cintra itself is surrounded by hotels and gardens. On a hill to the south
of it stands the sumptuous Castle de la Penha, whose eccentricities of architecture
are softened down by luxuriant masses of vegetation. Strangers likewise
visit the ruins of an old Moorish castle and the caverns of the “Monastery of
Cork,” thus named because its walls are covered with cork as a protection against
damp. The prospect from all the surrounding heights is magnificent, and most
so from the cliffs terminating in the famous Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point
of continental Europe.</p>

<p>The city of Mafra occupies a sterile plateau not far from the seaside resort of
Ericeira. Like Cintra, it boasts of an immense palace, the Escorial of the kings of
the house of Bragança, now used as a military school. João V., who erected this
structure, with its numerous churches, chapels, and cells, expended for that
purpose all the coin he could command, and when he died there was not enough
money left in the treasury to pay for a mass for the repose of his
soul. Far more <span class="xxpn" id="p489">{489}</span>
curious than this immense barrack, with its 5,200 windows, is the forsaken
monastery of Alcobaça, about sixty miles farther north, which was built in the
twelfth century to commemorate the victories over the Moors. Near it stands
the monastery of Batalha, which recalls the defeat of the Castilians in the plain of
Aljubarrota in 1385. The portals, cloisters, chapel, and chapter-room abound
in sculptures of marvellous finish, though of doubtful taste.</p>

<p>Leiria, the town nearest to Batalha, occupies a fine site at the confluence of the
rivers Liz and Lena, and is commanded by a Moorish castle, the old residence of
King Diniz the “Labourer,” who planted the <i>pinhal</i> of Leiria, the finest forest
in Portugal. After a long period of decadence this portion of the country has
entered upon a new epoch of activity. At Marinha Grande, near it, there are large
glass-works, which communicate by rail with the circular harbour of Concha
(shell) de São Martinho.</p>

<p>Thomar, formerly famous on account of its monastery, stands
on the eastern <span class="xxpn" id="p490">{490}</span>
slope of the hills commanding the plains of Batalha and Alcobaça. It is the
capital of the Knights of Christ, to whom was conceded the privilege of conquering
the Indies and the New World. They performed great deeds, but in the end
their rapacity led to the decadence of their native country. Thomar is a town of
cotton-mills now, but commerce is more active in the places on the Tejo, and
notably at Santarem, which, from its “marvellous” hill, looks down upon the
verdant isles of the river and the plains of Alemtejo. Santarem and the neighbouring
fortress of Abrantes supply Lisbon with vegetables and fruit, and the
country around them is a veritable forest of olive-trees.</p>

<p>The sandy soil and shallow rivers bounded by marshes of the country to the
south of the Tejo oppose serious obstacles to the establishment of important towns,
and if it were not for the vicinity of Lisbon it would probably be uninhabited.
Almada, opposite Lisbon, Seixal, Barreiro, Aldea Gallega, and Alcochete are mere
suburbs of the capital, and share in its prosperity or adversity. Setúbal, or
St. Ives, however, which lies farther to the south, on the estuary of the Sado, and
which has an excellent harbour, suffers from too great a proximity to Lisbon, for
Portugal is not rich enough to feed two ports so close to each other. Cezimbra,
on the steep coast which terminates in Cape Espichel, to the west of Setúbal, is
likewise a decayed place, and Troja, which preceded Setúbal as the emporium of
the Sado, now lies buried beneath the dunes. Excavations recently made on its
site have led to the discovery of Roman mosaics and of a street laid out, perhaps,
by the Phœnicians; and Link, the botanist, who visited the spot at the end of last
century, still found there the ruined courts of Moorish houses.</p>

<p>Setúbal, though its commercial activity is very much inferior to that of Lisbon,
still exports muscat wines, delicious oranges, and salt procured from the ponds in
its vicinity.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn179" id="fnanch179">179</a> The sea near Setúbal and Cezimbra abounds in fish and other
marine animals, and in comparison with it the Me­di­ter­ra­nean and Bay of Biscay
may almost be described as deserts. Long before scientific men explored the bottom
of the sea the fishermen of Setúbal hauled up from a depth of 300 fathoms
immense sharks. Ordinary fish are caught in myriads, and the inhabitants of
Cezimbra feed their pigs upon sardines. When Portugal was at the height of
its commercial prosperity it supplied a considerable portion of Europe with fish,
and almost enjoyed a monopoly in cod, which was exported even to Norway.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn180" id="fnanch180">180</a></p>

<p class="pfirst">The
mountains beyond the Tejo rarely assume the aspect of chains. For the
most part they rise but little above the surrounding plateau. This region is
the least attractive of all Portugal, and between the Tejo and the mountains
of Algarve there are only plains, monotonous hills, woods, and naked landes.
Human habitations are few and far between. The
lowlands along the Tejo and <span class="xxpn" id="p491">{491}</span>
the coast are covered with a thick layer of fine sand resting upon clay, and they
still exhibit clumps of maritime pines and holm-oaks, the remains of the ancient
forests which formerly covered the whole of the country. Farther inland we
reach the great landes, or <i>charnecas</i>, covered with an infinite variety of plants.
There are heaths growing sometimes to a height of six feet, rock-roses, juniper-trees,
rosemary, and creeping oaks. But the general aspect of the country is dreary,
in spite of the white and yellow flowers which cover it until the middle of winter,
for there are hardly any cultivated fields. The hills consist for the most part of
micaceous schists, and are covered with a monotonous growth of labdanum-yielding
rock-roses. This is a western extension of the zone of <i>jarales</i>, which covers so many
hundred square miles of the Sierra Morena and other mountain regions of Spain.</p>

<p>The Serra de São Mamede (3,363 feet), on the confines of Portugal, between
the valleys of the Tejo and Guadiana, is the highest mountain mass of Southern
Portugal; but its granitic ridges, enclosing narrow valleys
between them, hardly <span class="xxpn" id="p492">{492}</span>
rise 1,500 feet above the general level of the plateau. A second granitic mountain
mass rises to the south of the depression crossed by the railway from Lisbon
to Badajoz. This is the Serra de Ossa (2,130 feet). An undulating tract of
country joins it to other serras, forming steep escarpments towards the valleys of
the Guadiana and Sadão, and the monotonous plain known as Campo de Beja
(870 feet). The famous Campo de Ourique (700 feet), upon which 200,000
Moors, commanded by five kings, were defeated by the Portuguese in the middle
of the twelfth century, forms a southern continuation of that plain. This battle,
and the massacres which succeeded it, converted the plains to the south of the
Tejo into deserts.</p>

<p>The hills of that portion of Alemtejo which lies to the east of the Guadiana
belong to the system of the Sierra Morena of Spain. The river, which separates
them from the hills and plateaux of the west, is confined in a deep and narrow
gorge. At the <i>Pulo do Lobo</i> (“wolf’s leap”) it still descends in cataracts, and
becomes navigable only at Mertola, thirty-seven miles above its mouth.</p>

<p>The hills of Southern Alemtejo and Algarve, to the west of the Guadiana, are
at first mere swellings of the ground known as <i>cumeadas</i>, or “heights of land,” but
in the Serra do Malhão (1,886 feet) and the Serra da Mezquita they attain some
height. A plateau, traversed by the upper affluents of the Mira, joins the range
last mentioned to the Serra Caldeirão (1,272 feet), supposed to be named after some
ancient crater, or “caldron,” which terminates, to the north of Cape Sines, with
the Atalaya, or Sentinel (1,010 feet). The principal range continues towards the
west, and in the Serra de Monchique (2,963 feet), a mountain mass
filling up the <span class="xxpn" id="p493">{493}</span>
south-western corner of Portugal, it attains its culminating point. A steep ridge,
known as Espinhaço de Cão (“dog’s back”), extends from the latter in the direction
of the Capes of St. Vincent and Sagres.</p>

<p>The latter was selected by Henry the Navigator as the seat of the naval school
founded by him, and from its heights he watched for the return of the vessels
which he dispatched on exploratory expeditions. Associations such as these are
far more pleasurable than those connected with the neighbouring Cape St. Vincent,
where Admiral Jervis, in 1797, destroyed a Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>The hills of Sagres are of volcanic origin, and the subsidence of portions of
the coast of Algarve appears to prove that subterranean forces are still active.
Wherever this subsidence has been observed the coast is fringed by sand-banks,
thrown up by the waves of the sea, the channel separating them from the mainland
being navigable for small vessels.</p>

<p>If a traveller ascend one of the culminating points of the mountains of Algarve,
he cannot fail to be struck with the remarkable contrast existing between the districts
to the north and south of him. On the one side he looks down upon vast solitudes
resembling deserts; on the other he perceives forests of chestnut-trees,
numerous villages, towns bordering the seashore, and fleets of fishing-boats rocking
upon the blue waves. The contrasts between the inhabitants of
these two districts <span class="xxpn" id="p494">{494}</span>
are scarcely less striking. The inhabitants of Alemtejo are the most solemn of
Portuguese, and even object to dancing. Very thinly scattered over the landes
which they inhabit, they either engage in agriculture or follow their herds of pigs
and sheep into the forests of holm-oaks and thickets of rock-roses. In summer
they cross the Tejo with their pigs, and pasture them in the mountains of Beira.
The population of Algarve, on the other hand, is thrice as dense as that of Alemtejo,
and not only are fields, vineyards, and orchards carefully tended, but the sea
likewise is made to yield a portion of its food. The contrast between the two
provinces is partly accounted for by the fact that most of the great battles were
fought on the undulating plains of Alemtejo. When the Romans held the country
Alemtejo supported a numerous population, as is proved by the large number of
inscriptions found.</p>

<p>Differences of altitude and geographical position sufficiently account for the
differences of climate existing between the two provinces. Alemtejo, with its
monotonous plains and stunted vegetation, is almost African in its aspect, whilst
Algarve, with its forests of olive-trees, groves of date-palms, agaves, and prickly
cacti, presents us with tropical features. The mean temperature near the coast is
probably no less than 68° F. The Serra de Monchique bars the cool winds of the
north, whilst the sandy islands fringing a portion of the coast keep off refreshing
sea breezes. The hottest wind of all is that which blows from the east. It is
often laden with fever-breeding miasmata, and a proverb says, <i>De Espanha nem bom
vento nem bom casamento</i>: “Neither good winds nor good weddings are bred in
Spain.”</p>

<p>Villanova de Portimão, to the south of the Serra de Monchique, has long been
looked upon as the hottest place in Europe; there are, however, several localities
in Spain which rival it in that respect. Thus much is certain,
that Algarve, with <span class="xxpn" id="p495">{495}</span>
the lower valley of the Guadalquivir and the southern coasts of Andalusia and
Murcia, constitutes the most torrid portion of Europe. The Arabs were quite right
when they designated Southern Lusitania and the opposite shore of Morocco by the
same name of “el Gharb;” that is, the two Algarves, or “eastern districts.”
Portuguese Algarve, in spite of the conversion of its inhabitants to Christianity,
has retained its ancient Moorish name; and the Berber and Semitic blood is very
conspicuous there.</p>

<p>In Upper Alemtejo there are but few towns, and these would be altogether
insignificant if it were not for the overland commerce carried on with Spain.
Crato, which is the most considerable station on the railway which joins the Tejo
to the Guadiana, and its neighbour Portalegre, were formerly important stages on
the great overland route. Elvas, farther to the south, is surrounded by orchards,
and defended by forts which were looked upon in the last century as masterpieces
of military architecture. It faces the Spanish fortress of Badajoz, as well as
Olivença, which was assigned to Portugal by the treaty of Vienna, but never
surrendered by Spain. Estremoz, on a spur of the Serra de Ossa, is famous
throughout Portugal for its <i>búcaros</i>—elegantly modelled earthen jars which
diffuse a sweet odour. Montemor looks down from its hill upon vast landes and
monotonous woods. Evora, likewise built on a hill, commands an extensive plain.
It was a populous place during the dominion of the Romans, and in the Middle
Ages became the second residence of the Kings of Portugal. There exist now only
a Roman aqueduct, the ruins of a temple of Venus, Corinthian columns, and the
remains of mediæval castles to remind us of its ancient splendours.</p>

<p>Beja, the ancient <i>Pax Julia</i> or <i>Colonia Pacensis</i> of the Romans, has likewise
lost its former importance, but Minas de São Domingos, on the peninsula formed
by the confluence of the Guadiana and the Chanza, is rapidly increasing, thanks to
its mines of pyrites of copper and other minerals, which are being worked by an
English company. The ore is conveyed by rail to Pomarão, on the Guadiana, and
thence on barges to Villa Real de Santo Antonio, at its mouth, formerly a mere
fishing village, but now a busy port. Castro Marim, where the expeditions against
the Moors used to be fitted out, is close to it.</p>

<p>Silves, the ancient Moorish capital of Algarve, lies in the interior of the country,
far removed from the present highways of commerce. Faro, the modern capital,
has the advantage of lying on the seashore, and of possessing a secure harbour,
whence small coasters are able to export fruit, tunny-fish, sardines, and oysters.
Tavira possesses the same advantages, and exports the same articles: it is said
to be the prettiest town of Algarve. Loulé, in a delightful inland valley, is a
pretty place, and, when invalids have learnt the road to Algarve, may obtain
some importance as a winter resort. The Caldas (warm baths) de Monchique (600
feet) enjoy a world-wide reputation even now, not only because of their efficacy, but
also on account of the delicious climate and charming environs. This district is said
to produce the best oranges in Portugal.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn181" id="fnanch181">181</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p496">{496}</span></p>

Portugal no longer shares with her neighbour, Spain, in the dominion of
the world, as in the fifteenth century. The secrecy observed with a view to the
retention of the monopoly of trade with countries newly discovered proved in the end
most injurious to Portugal. Other nations appeared upon the stage which the
Portuguese had dreamt of occupying for ever, and though the latter still hold
colonies vastly superior in area to the mother country, this is nothing in comparison
with what has been irretrievably lost. Vasco da Gama discovered the ocean high-road
to India, but the few settlements which Portugal still holds there she owes to
the favour of England. In the Malay Archipelago Portugal has been supplanted
almost completely by the Dutch, and Macao, at the entrance of the Canton River,
was hardly more than a slave market until quite recently, from which Chinese
“emigrants” were exported to Peru. In Africa Portugal holds vast possessions,
if we are to believe in official documents and maps, but in reality only a very
small tract of territory is under the dominion of the Portuguese, and most of
the commerce is carried on through Dutch and other foreign houses. As to Brazil,
it now surpasses the mother country in population and wealth.
Madeira and the <span class="xxpn" id="p497">{497}</span>
Azores, the first conquests made by Lisbon navigators, are looked upon as integral
portions of Portugal; they enjoy the same rights, and are quite equal to it in
wealth.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn182" id="fnanch182">182</a></p>

<p>When Brazil was lost to Portugal that small country found itself in a position
of lamentable prostration. Exhausted by foreign and internecine wars, its finances
utterly ruined, and without roads to enable it to export its produce, it might have
disappeared from our maps without any interests, except those of a few English
vine-growers and Spanish smugglers, being affected. Even in 1851 there only
existed a single carriage road in the country, namely, that which connected Lisbon
with the royal palace at Cintra. No attention whatever was paid to education,
and about a generation ago a girl able to read was a phenomenon. At the same
time we must not forget that these illiterate Portuguese knew how to discuss a
subject without quarrelling, had great command of their language, and were
able even to improvise verses of great poetical merit, in all of which respects they
contrasted favourably with the peasantry of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>In the course of the last generation education has made much progress in
Portugal;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn183" id="fnanch183">183</a> and in other respects, too, the country has gradually assimilated with the
rest of Europe. Roads and railways have been constructed,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn184" id="fnanch184">184</a> and the latter connect
Lisbon not only with the leading provincial towns, but also with Spain. The commerce
with the latter country increases regularly with the occurrence of civil war,
when Portugal profits at the expense of the Spanish
ports of the Me­di­ter­ra­nean. <span class="xxpn" id="p498">{498}</span>
Much of the ordinary commerce with Spain never appears in the customs registries,
for it is carried on by smugglers, who glory in evading the vigilance of the frontier
police.</p>

<p>The commerce of Portugal has increased very much in the course of
the last thirty years. More than half of it falls to the share of Great
Britain, a cir­cum­stance not to be won­dered at when we bear in mind
the rel­a­tive geo­graph­i­cal po­si­tion of the two coun­tries, for Portugal
lies upon the direct route fol­lowed by English steamers pro­ceed­ing to
the Med­i­ter­ranean, Wes­tern Af­ri­ca, or Bra­zil. The as­sis­tance which
England ren­dered Por­tugal during the pe­nin­su­lar war has ce­men­ted these
com­mer­cial bonds.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The com­mer­cial re­la­tions with Brazil, now joined to Lis­bon by a
sub­marine cable, are like­wise the nat­ural re­sult of the rela­tive
pos­i­tions of the two coun­tries and of the com­mon origin of their
pop­u­la­tions. Portugal, in fact, par­ti­ci­pates in every pro­gress made by
its old colony, and its com­merce will as­sume immense pro­por­tions when
slavery is abolished in Brazil, when the sol­i­tudes of the Amazonas
resound with the stir of in­dus­trious pop­u­la­tions, and the coasts of the
Pacific are joined to the At­lan­tic by means of rail­ways cros­sing the
Andes.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn185" id="fnanch185">185</a></p>

<p>But, after all, it will be Spain with
which the most intimate commercial
relations must finally be established, in spite of national prejudices and dynastic
interests. The two nations will in the end become one, as the Aragonese and
Castilians, the Andalusians and Manchegos, have become one. It is merely a
question of time; but who can doubt that community of industrial and social relations
will lead to a political union. We only trust that this union may be brought
about without a resort to brute force, and with due regard to special interests.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Portugal
is an hereditary and constitutional monarchy. In accordance with the
Carta de Ley of 1826, as revised in 1852, the King is
charged with the executive, <span class="xxpn" id="p499">{499}</span>
and shares the power of making laws with two chambers. He receives a civil list of
£144,000, enjoys the income from certain Crown lands, and possesses magnificent
Crown jewels, amongst which the “diamond of Bragança” is the most famous.
In default of male heirs the crown descends in the female line. “His most faithful
Majesty” still claims to be “King of the two Algarves, Lord of Guinea and of
the Conquests.” The seven ministers of the Crown are responsible for the King’s
actions; they may be impeached by the Chamber of Deputies, and are judged by
the Chamber of Peers. A Privy Council of an indefinite number of members,
appointed for life, advises the King in all questions of administration. The heir
presumptive takes part in its deliberations on attaining his eighteenth year.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Peers consists of about a hundred members, some of them
hereditary and others appointed by the King. Its meetings are presided over by
the Patriarch of Lisbon. The Chamber of Deputies is elective, and the discussion
of the budget and granting of supplies are specially reserved to it. All
males more than twenty-five years of age are entitled to the franchise if they pay
4s. 6d. in direct taxes, or 22s. from real estate. Graduates of universities, certified
teachers, officers, and priests are not required to possess any property qualification,
and they, as well as all married men, become enfranchised on completing their
twenty-first year. All electors are eligible as deputies if they pay 18s. in direct
taxes, or 90s. from real estate. Every 25,000 inhabitants are represented by a
deputy. The President of the Chamber is selected by the King from five
candidates presented by the deputies. The latter are entitled to remuneration.</p>

<p>For judicial purposes the country is divided into twenty-six districts, or
<i>comarcas</i>, with eighty-five courts. There are courts of appeal at Lisbon and
Oporto, and a supreme court at Lisbon. Parish judges (<i>juiz eleito</i>), elected by the
people, exercise the inferior jurisdiction. Juries give their verdict on questions of
fact in civil as well as in criminal cases. The principal codes still in force are the
“Codigo Alfonsino” of the fifteenth century, the “Codigo Manoelino” (1513),
and the “Codigo Filippino,” introduced by Philip IV. of Spain. A Commercial
Code was published in 1833.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic religion is that of the State, but Protestant places of
ship are suffered to exist in the seaports. The hierarchy includes a patriarch
residing at Lisbon, two archbishops at Braga and Evora, and fourteen bishops.
The Inquisition was abolished in 1821, and the monasteries, 750 in number, as well
as most of the convents, were suppressed in 1834, and their revenues confiscated
for the benefit of the State.</p>

<p>The army numbers 1,650 officers and 38,000 men, of whom about two-thirds
are under colours during peace. On a war footing it is to be raised to 2,418
officers and 70,687 men. All men are obliged to serve either in the army or in
the reserve, and exemption can no longer be purchased. The fortresses are
numerous, but only a few of them are capable of being defended against modern
artillery. The most important are Elvas, Abrantes, and Valença, near the Spanish
frontier, the fort of São Julião and the citadel of Peniche on the coast. The navy
no longer numbers a thousand vessels, as it did when King
Sebastian started for <span class="xxpn" id="p500">{500}</span>
the invasion of Morocco. It consists now of twenty-seven steamers, including an
ironclad corvette, and eleven sailing vessels, manned by 3,000 men and armed
with 171 guns.</p>

<p>The public revenue approaches £6,000,000 sterling, and ever since 1834 there
has been annually a deficit, which has resulted in a national debt of more than
£80,000,000, a burden almost too heavy for a small country like Portugal. The
revenue is, however, increasing, a balance between income and expenditure has
been established within the last year or two, and the wretched expedient of
deducting from 5 to 30 per cent. of the salaries of Government officials could be
dispensed with for the first time in 1875.</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have
generally been retained, with some exceptions noted below.
Footnotes have been converted to endnotes, inserted ahead
of the Index, and renumbered 1–185. Original printed page
numbers are shown like this: {52}. Enlarged curly brackets
} or { used as graphic devices to combine information on
two or more lines of text have been eliminated. Ditto marks
have been eliminated. The transcriber produced the cover
image and hereby assigns it to the public domain. Original
page images are available from archive.org — search for<br
/> “earthitsinhabita01recl”.</p>

<p>Illustrations originally printed within paragraphs
of text have been moved to nearby locations between
paragraphs. In the epub and mobi editions, all of the
images are smaller than 601 by 801 pixels, and image file
sizes are less than 100kb. Larger image files with better
resolution are available for many images. <i>In the <span
class="fsz6">HTML</span> edition only</i>, these are linked
with the symbol “Μ” in the caption. Alternatively, all
of the images are available from the Project Gutenberg
download page for this book. The original scanned images
have been only conservatively edited for these editions in
order to avoid destruction of detail.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a
href="#p005" title="go to p. 5">5</a>. There were two pages numbered
5, which are the last page of the Introductory Remarks—the latter is
now {5a}—and the first page of Chapter I.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a
 href="#p086" title="go to p. 86">86</a>. The number 44,557 at the end of the table was not
printed clearly, and so could be erroneous in this edition.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a
 href="#p093" title="go to p. 93">93</a>, Fig. 29.
Changed “1&#x202f;:&#x202f;2 470,000” to “1&#x202f;:&#x202f;2,470,000”.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a href="#fn28" title="go to note 28">104n</a>.
The note beginning “Length of the Bosphorus” had
no anchor in the text. A new one has been placed on page
103, after “shores of Europe and Asia.”</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a href="#fn43" title="go to note 43">152n</a>. In the table,
the row headings in the left columns were indented in the printed book
in an unhelpful fashion. Of the three rows headed “Turkey in Europe”,
“Turkey in Asia”, and “Tripoli, &amp;c.”, the first represents the sum
of the rows above, while the next two are independent, but all three
were indented the same. In this edition, the row heading indents have
been modified to more usefully reflect the structure of the table.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a href="#fn48" title="go to note 48">166n</a>.
Changed the phrase “52,500 foreigners 30,000 Austrians,
10,000 Greeks, 5,000 Germans, 1,500 French)” to “52,500
foreigners (30,000 Austrians, 10,000 Greeks, 5,000 Germans,
1,500 French)”.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a href="#p223" title="go to p. 223">223</a>.
“Quadilateral” to “Quadrilateral”.</p>

“Chiavari, 8 414” to “Chiavari, 8,414”.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page <a href="#fn92" title="go to note 92">280n</a>.
The number printed for the water supply of Washington, per inhabitant,
is not clear, but might be 660, as rendered herein.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page
<a href="#fn97" title="go to note 97">283n</a>.
“foriegn” to “foreign”.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page
<a href="#fn98" title="go to note 98">284n</a>.
“Pesaro, 12, 75;”, where the blank shown here was not quite blank
in the print, is changed to “Pesaro, 12,375;”, on weak evidence.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page
<a href="#fn119" title="go to note 119">352n</a>.
“Cagliari, 31,9&nbsp;5” is retained from the printed book.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page
<a href="#p470" title="go to p. 470">470</a>,
Fig. 191. In the caption, the name rendered herein as “Jelinek”
was not printed clearly.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc">Page

<a href="#p500" title="go to p. 500">500</a>.
In the second table, the number “47·223” means
forty-seven thousand two hundred twenty-three. This may be
the only instance in this book of a middle dot used as a

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
